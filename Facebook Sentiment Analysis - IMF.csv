8-Jun,9:49 AM,Video,,Analyze This: Migration Integrating migrants into the labor force helps countries reap the economic benefits of a world on the move.,1:37,1000,17,47,,1,,,,"Muscat: A number of expatriate medical staff in Oman who have alleged that their severance packages have been cut or withheld are waiting for their embassy’s response to resolve their issues.

A senior official from the Philippine embassy said that they have forwarded the nurses claim to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) in Oman and the embassy will be meeting the nurses on coming Wednesday.

“We had received a letter from at least 40 nurses. The Philippines ambassador to Oman has forwarded the same to MoFA. We are waiting for their response. Meanwhile, we will be meeting the nurses too,” Nasser Mustafa, labour attaché at the Philippines Embassy in Oman, told the Times of Oman.

A few weeks ago, hundreds of Indian paramedical staff and medics had approached the Indian embassy with the same claim.

According to the expat medical staff, a majority of them, who have joined services in Oman between 1985 and 1994 are being reportedly denied full service gratuity.

12-year gratuity payment

They have been told to take 12-year gratuity payment, even though they have worked for more than 25 years in Oman. This has left many in the lurch as banking on the eventual payment of gratuity money they had many plans, including paying off loans.

Talking to the Times of Oman earlier, Indra Mani Pandey, India’s ambassador to Oman, said: “The embassy has been working in close cooperation with the concerned authorities in Oman to address the grievances of Indian professionals and workers brought to the attention of the embassy.”

Many, who took loans from local banks hoping to get full service gratuity to meet family needs, are now struggling to repay them as banks have issued notices.

Meanwhile, speaking on the condition of anonymity, a nurse said she was denied full service gratuity initially but later found her name on the list of full entitlement.

“I was denied full service gratuity. I had 25 years of service, but was only given 12 years gratuity. I filed a case. However, after pursuing the matter further with the ministry, I found that I had signed a document, which enables me to be eligible for full service gratuity. Now, I have approached legal advisors on this issue too,” she added.

According to medical staff, up until June 2016, everyone who was told to retire or retired voluntarily was supposed to receive full service benefits.

However, the nurses claimed that those who were told to leave after June are not getting full service benefits in line with their years spent in service.

“In 1994, a government decision promised everyone full service benefits. Some of the hospital nurses had gotten it signed, but unfortunately many did not,” a nurse added.

Expat doctors who talked to the Times of Oman said they are confused as to what gratuity they will get. “Some are getting full and some are not. It is a worrisome situation. Many have had to leave with slashed gratuity,” one medic said.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health has declined to comment on the issue. Recently, the Times of Oman had reported that private sector employers are forcing expat to give up their end-of-service payments for to get a No Objection Certificate.",Hameed Kormat,2,8-Jun,10:20 AM,,

Secondly, how can IMF better advise a government to better strengthen and make efficient a country's tax administration?

I don't blame some of this systems. I only blame our lazy leaders. They will fall for anything to look rich. 
I hope you check the debt to GDP ratio of the countries you that keep creeping on your so called support. 
Let us get serious here. Using my country as an example, Ghana a West African country, is one of the countries for which our leaders finds it very convince to fall for your creepy deal. I can assure you that we are getting broke by day. We may look beautiful from far but a closer look at our economy leaves much to be worried about.
I do pity our Youth and generation to come. Should our leaders continue selling our country out to you, they will leave nothing behind for any better future.
I am ashamed with the way our Government wouldn't hesitate in signing deals every now and then yet we keep getting poorer and poorer.
Indeed, if IMF is here to help, let us feel it.
We have very good institutions that are weak; help strengthen them.
We have lot of resources that are not fully harnessed; help us utilize them.
We have wars and diseases to handle. Please take your planned war and disease out.
We have lots of debts to settle you, pleas do not add us more.
We have lots of mismanagement in our system, advice our leaders to be extra caring for the followers.
To our leaders, we can not continue to in this direction. It is high time you say no or have us not behind you.
The Youth are beginning to understand what's going on. 
We must be able to live beyond AIDS, GRANDS, BOUNDS and RELIEFS.
If a fairer world is your wish, IMF, please redirect your support to education. Give us education.
Education, one of which we can, stand up for our rights. 
An education that will give us the ability to utilize of natural resources to derive maximum benefit.
A kinda, education that will empower us not enslave us to Debt.
You either educate us now or know that you are not helping us in anyway.

Muscat: A number of expatriate medical staff in Oman who have alleged that their severance packages have been cut or withheld are waiting for their embassy’s response to resolve their issues.

A senior official from the Philippine embassy said that they have forwarded the nurses claim to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) in Oman and the embassy will be meeting the nurses on coming Wednesday.

“We had received a letter from at least 40 nurses. The Philippines ambassador to Oman has forwarded the same to MoFA. We are waiting for their response. Meanwhile, we will be meeting the nurses too,” Nasser Mustafa, labour attaché at the Philippines Embassy in Oman, told the Times of Oman.

A few weeks ago, hundreds of Indian paramedical staff and medics had approached the Indian embassy with the same claim.

According to the expat medical staff, a majority of them, who have joined services in Oman between 1985 and 1994 are being reportedly denied full service gratuity.

12-year gratuity payment

They have been told to take 12-year gratuity payment, even though they have worked for more than 25 years in Oman. This has left many in the lurch as banking on the eventual payment of gratuity money they had many plans, including paying off loans.

Talking to the Times of Oman earlier, Indra Mani Pandey, India’s ambassador to Oman, said: “The embassy has been working in close cooperation with the concerned authorities in Oman to address the grievances of Indian professionals and workers brought to the attention of the embassy.”

Many, who took loans from local banks hoping to get full service gratuity to meet family needs, are now struggling to repay them as banks have issued notices.

Meanwhile, speaking on the condition of anonymity, a nurse said she was denied full service gratuity initially but later found her name on the list of full entitlement.

“I was denied full service gratuity. I had 25 years of service, but was only given 12 years gratuity. I filed a case. However, after pursuing the matter further with the ministry, I found that I had signed a document, which enables me to be eligible for full service gratuity. Now, I have approached legal advisors on this issue too,” she added.

According to medical staff, up until June 2016, everyone who was told to retire or retired voluntarily was supposed to receive full service benefits.

However, the nurses claimed that those who were told to leave after June are not getting full service benefits in line with their years spent in service.

“In 1994, a government decision promised everyone full service benefits. Some of the hospital nurses had gotten it signed, but unfortunately many did not,” a nurse added.

Expat doctors who talked to the Times of Oman said they are confused as to what gratuity they will get. “Some are getting full and some are not. It is a worrisome situation. Many have had to leave with slashed gratuity,” one medic said.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health has declined to comment on the issue. Recently, the Times of Oman had reported that private sector employers are forcing expat to give up their end-of-service payments for to get a No Objection Certificate.",Hameed Kormat,12,, · Reply · May 8 at 11:16pm,,

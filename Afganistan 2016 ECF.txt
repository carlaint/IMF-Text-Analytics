IMF Executive Board Approves A US$44.9 million Extended Credit Facility
Arrangement to Support the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement for the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for
SDR 32.38 million (US$44.9 million, or 10 percent of quota) to help raise growth by
consolidating progress on the macroeconomic and structural fronts and catalyzing continued
support from donors.
Following the Board’s decision, SDR 4.5 million (about US$6.2 million) is available for
immediate disbursement; the remaining amount will be phased in over the duration of the
program, subject to semi-annual reviews.
Following the Board discussion, Mr. Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“Afghanistan is undergoing a difficult political, security, and economic transition. Against
this background, the authorities’ successful completion of the 2015 staff-monitored program
has provided the needed track record for a financial arrangement with the Fund. The
authorities’ program supported under the Fund’s Extended Credit Facility aims to consolidate
recent gains on the macroeconomic and structural fronts, and catalyze donor support. It will
focus on institution building, fiscal and financial reforms, and measures to combat
corruption. These reforms will help lay the foundation for private sector development, in line
with the goal of Afghanistan’s forthcoming National Development Framework.
“On the fiscal side, the program aims to raise revenue and reduce reliance on aid through tax
administration and policy reforms; improve the formulation, execution, and reporting of the
budget; ensure a pro-growth re-composition of public spending over time; and strengthen
commitment controls and cash management.

2

“The program envisions bolstering financial stability and the central bank’s regulatory and
supervisory frameworks to address remaining financial risks, including the need to complete
the resolution of the 2010 Kabul Bank crisis.
“The reform agenda also includes strong anti-corruption measures and implementation of
further reforms of the AML/CFT framework, which are critical to protecting financial
stability, deterring corruption, and exiting the Financial Action Task Force’s monitoring
process.
“The program will support a policy mix that aims to preserve macro-financial stability by
strengthening fiscal and external balances, keeping inflation low, and maintaining exchange
rate flexibility and strong buffers.
“In view of the challenging circumstances, full ownership of the program and buy-in from
stakeholders will help mitigate implementation risks and raise the likelihood of program
success.”
ANNEX
Recent Developments
Afghanistan is undergoing a challenging political, security, and economic transition.
Continued insecurity, political uncertainty, weak institutions and corruption are salient
factors preventing robust and inclusive economic growth.
Against this background and following the sizable reduction of the International Security
Assistance Force stationed in the country, real GDP growth declined from 11.5 percent in
2007-12 to 1.5 percent in 2013-15 and was 0.8 percent in 2015. While an uptick of growth to
2 percent is projected for 2016, it remains far below the level needed to ensure increased
employment and improved living standards. Large fiscal and external deficits continue to be
financed by donor aid. Risks, related to uncertain security conditions and potential shortfalls
in external support, are tilted to the downside.
The nine-month Staff Monitored Program (SMP) approved in May 2015 was successfully
completed in April 2016. The SMP aimed at addressing fiscal and banking vulnerabilities,
preserving macroeconomic stability, improving prospects for inclusive growth, and building
a track record for a future IMF financial arrangement.
Program Summary
The authorities’ program supported by the ECF sets out a structural reform agenda that
focuses on institution building, fiscal and financial reforms, and measures to combat
corruption to lay the foundations for scaled up private sector development. The envisaged
reforms, which are in the areas of the Fund’s comparative advantage and complementary to
reforms supported by donors, dovetail with Afghanistan’s National Development Framework

3

currently being finalized. The program aims to preserve macro-financial stability by
implementing prudent fiscal, monetary, and financial policies, and by maintaining external
buffers and a flexible exchange rate regime. The program’s major elements are as follows:
Fiscal reforms: On the revenue side, the priorities include strengthening current tax policies
and administration, and customs revenue collection control and capacity. On the expenditure
side, priorities include improving formulation, execution, and reporting of the budget;
ensuring a pro-growth re-composition of public spending while safeguarding social and other
priority spending; and strengthening commitment control and allotment processes to better
manage cash and improve transparency.
Anti-corruption measures and financial governance: Strong anti-corruption measures are
crucial for Afghanistan to build trust and accountability, minimize revenue leakages, and
improve the business environment. The authorities have taken steps to improve the anticorruption framework since 2014, and plan to align the legal framework for anti-corruption
with international standards as well as improve enforcement and transparency—notably by
strengthening the asset declaration regime and its implementation. The authorities plan to
enhance implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework, in particular the regulation on currency reporting at
borders and the fit and proper regulation.
Policies to preserve macro-financial stability: The ECF arrangement will aim to gradually
reduce underlying fiscal and external imbalances to prepare for a time when donor aid
declines. Buffers—low public debt and ample international reserves—will remain strong to
absorb adverse shocks. The budget will increasingly favor development spending to support
a recovery in growth, while financial sector policies will aim to strengthen vulnerable and
weak banks and reform the state-owned commercial banks. On the latter, the program
incorporates measures to complete the resolution of the 2010 Kabul Bank crisis through
recapitalizing New Kabul Bank and reducing the central bank’s lender of last resort exposure
to Kabul Bank. Monetary policy will continue to be focused on maintaining price stability
and a flexible exchange rate regime, while fostering confidence in the domestic currency in
the context of high dollarization.
Additional Background
The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which became of member of the IMF on July 14, 1955,
has an IMF quota of SDR 323.80 million

REQUEST FOR A THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT UNDER
THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY

KEY ISSUES
Context. Afghanistan is a fragile highly aid dependent state undergoing a difficult
political, security, and economic transition that is posing difficult challenges for the
government. Insecurity, political uncertainty, endemic corruption, weak institutions, an
infrastructure deficit, weak human capital, and a large narcotics sector are the salient
factors preventing robust and inclusive economic development.
Program objectives and modalities. Following the successful completion of the
2015 staff-monitored program, the authorities have requested a financial arrangement
under the Extended Credit Facility to help consolidate progress on the macroeconomic
and structural fronts and catalyze continued support from donors, helping to raise
growth. The program’s structural reforms focus on areas of the Fund’s comparative
advantage and are complementary to reforms supported by donors. While there are
protracted medium-term balance of payments pressures, there is no immediate balance
of payments need, given grants of about 40 percent of GDP and a comfortable
international reserves position. Hence, a three-year program is envisaged with access at
10 percent of quota (SDR 32.38 million, about US$45 million), that can be augmented if
adverse shocks were to cause international reserves to drop below an adequate level.
Capacity to repay is assessed as adequate, although the country’s fragility and fluid
political context imply some risks.
Program policies. The program sets out a structural reform agenda that focuses on
institution building, fiscal and financial reforms, and measures to combat corruption to
lay the foundations for scaled up private sector development. The envisaged reforms
dovetail with Afghanistan’s National Development Framework currently being finalized.
The program aims to preserve macro-financial stability by implementing prudent fiscal,
monetary, and financial policies, and by maintaining external buffers and a flexible
exchange rate regime.
Staff views. Staff supports the authorities’ request for an ECF arrangement under
a Fund-supported program. The Letter of Intent and Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies provide for appropriate policies to pursue the objectives of
the program. The program, however, carries some risks including (i) a deterioration in
the security situation; (ii) a shortfall in donor aid; and (iii) increased political uncertainty,
particularly with regard to elections scheduled for the fall. These risks, were they to
materialize, could lead to lower growth, unexpected financing gaps, and problems with
program implementation.

CONTEXT
1.
Afghanistan is undergoing a political, security, and economic transition that is posing
difficult challenges for the government. Continued insecurity, political uncertainty, endemic
corruption, weak institutions, an infrastructure deficit, weak human capital, and a large illicit
narcotics sector are the salient factors preventing robust and inclusive economic development.


Growth, having averaged 11½ percent in
2007-12, collapsed to 1½ percent in 2013–15 as
the size of the International Security Assistance
Force stationed in the country fell from
130,000 to 13,000. An estimated 500,000 jobs
were lost in recent years following the troop
withdrawal. Political uncertainty and rising
insecurity compounded this drag on economic
activity.



Prospects for a peace agreement with insurgents
are uncertain and violence is on the rise.



Political uncertainty persists as the power sharing arrangement between President Ghani and
Chief Executive Abdullah, and therefore the government’s cohesion, continues to be tested.



Emigration emerged as a major issue in 2015, with violence and weak economic conditions
being the main push factors.1 These pressures have recently abated.

2.
The nine-month Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) approved in May 2015 was
successful. The SMP aimed at addressing fiscal and banking vulnerabilities, preserving
macroeconomic stability, improving prospects for inclusive growth, and building a track record for
a future IMF financial arrangement. All quantitative targets and most structural benchmarks were
met, while remaining benchmarks were completed by the end of the SMP.
3.
The authorities have requested an ECF arrangement to help address low revenue,
financial sector vulnerabilities, and governance gaps, and thus, assist in improving the conditions for
sustainable growth and in catalyzing support from donors. Donors are supportive of this intensified
Fund engagement, and view an ECF arrangement as important in building confidence and support
ahead of the Brussels donors’ conference in early October, 2016.

Budget indicators are improving. Domestic
revenues increased by 28 percent year-on-year in the first five months of 2016, on account of
measures introduced in the second half of 2015. Operating budget execution3 improved owing to
acceleration in procurement in the security sector and a pick-up in wage and pension payments.
Development budget execution, however, has not picked up (despite the authorities’ plans to
increase it over time from 53 to 80 percent of the budgeted amount), reflecting delays in
procurement and submission of invoices. The overall budget recorded a surplus of about 2.5 percent
of annual GDP after grants, and the treasury’s discretionary cash balance increased to over
Af 30 billion (2.5 percent of GDP), equivalent to 1.5 months of operating spending.

6.
The trade and current account (before official grants) deficits remain large, although
data deficiencies complicate an assessment. Staff estimates the former at about 37 percent of
GDP and the latter at about 33 percent of GDP in 2015. While imports of goods declined by about
10 percent in 2015, exports of goods, consisting mainly of agricultural products and excluding
opium and internal sales to nonresidents, declined by about 15 percent on account of unfavorable
weather and disruptions in transportation as well as falling prices. Anecdotal evidence suggests
some improvements in these factors since the beginning of 2016,4 but given Afghanistan’s large
dependence on imports,5 the impact on the trade deficit will be limited. The current account deficit
continues to be more than fully covered by official grants.
7.
Exchange rate pressures decreased in the first five months of 2016 as emigration and
related capital outflows have decelerated. The Afghani depreciated slightly against the U.S. dollar,
by one percent relative to end-2015. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) continues to supply foreign
exchange to the domestic FX markets,6 but its sales volumes have fallen: US$0.7 billion in the first
five months against US$1.2 billion in the same period a year ago. Gross international reserves cover
almost nine months of imports.
8.
The financial sector remains vulnerable and plays a limited role in financial
intermediation. The sector is marked by lingering governance concerns, deteriorating asset quality,
and weak profitability. Public confidence, shattered by the 2010 Kabul Bank fraud and collapse, has
not fully recovered yet. The high liquidity and solvency ratios are misleading and reflect the fact that
banks do not play their intermediation role, with an average system-wide loan-to-deposit ratio of
only 19.2 percent and 4.6 percent for the three state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) as of
December 2015.

Besides favorable weather, improvements in storage facilities are making Afghanistan’s exports of goods more
resilient to disruptions in transport. Moreover, exporters’ confidence has improved somewhat due to the World Trade
Organization’s approval of Afghanistan’s membership and an agreement between Afghanistan, India, and Iran on
developing the Chabahar port in Iran, the only Iranian port with direct ocean access.

Afghanistan’s exports of goods are less than one-tenth of imports (less than 4 percent of GDP). A substantial part of
goods imports (40 percent) is assumed to be closely linked to official grants.

DAB operates under a de facto managed floating exchange rate regime. It adjusts its FX sales (which is the primary
tool for monetary operations in the absence of an effective alternative) to avoid excessive exchange rate volatility
that may affect price stability.

B. Outlook and Risks
9.
The outlook remains challenging. The perilous security situation and political uncertainties
remain the key constraints to improved economic outcomes, crowding out development spending,
undermining private investment, and complicating the implementation of reforms. Endemic
corruption reduces economic efficiency, undermines institutions, and fosters inequality.
10.
Potential for medium-term growth is likely to be resource-based. Past work by the
World Bank identified agriculture and mining as core to a development strategy.7 With supportive
policy reforms, the agricultural sector could contribute to growth and employment relatively soon.
Development of the mining sector is more distant, as it depends on an improvement in the
investment climate, renegotiation of several existing contracts, and a robust fiscal regime for
extractive industries to assuage investor concerns over corruption. The impending construction of
the CASA line will provide for transmission corridors and the potential for exporting electricity.8 The
authorities have noted that trade and regional integration could be a growth driver and aim to
develop Afghanistan into a trade and transportation hub for the region. However, such integration is
likely slow to materialize.
11.
Staff noted that a critical mass of reforms is needed to lay the foundation for robust
and inclusive growth. The payoff from reforms is likely to be gradual, based on the experience of
other fragile countries, and difficult to forecast, particularly given high insecurity. Growth has shown
high volatility in the past, and the distorting effect of drug production and trafficking is an additional
source of uncertainty.
The Reform Scenario
12.
Given high output volatility in the past and
the inherent uncertainties going forward, staff relies
on scenarios rather than projections to quantify the
outlook. In particular, the macroeconomic framework in
this report assumes implementation of comprehensive
structural reforms, including in the context of the ECF
arrangement. This “reform” scenario builds on a “current
policies scenario” presented in the May 2016 staff
report9 and incorporates the policies described in the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies

(MEFP), in addition to the assumptions of increased political stability and unchanged security
situation.


The reform package, combined with other broader reforms outside the ECF arrangement (e.g.,
business climate and financial inclusion), is assumed to raise private demand and public
investment financed by higher domestic revenues. As a supply response kicks in, these factors
are assumed to improve the growth trajectory, leading to a gradual upward shift that begins in
2017 and has an impact of 2 percentage points by 2021.10



Broad money is assumed to grow around
8 percent yearly in the medium term, consistent
with the inflation forecast of 7 percent.



Grant inflows are anticipated to remain significant
but gradually fall, from a projected 41 percent of
GDP in 2016 to 26 percent by 2021.
Approximately half will be disbursed outside the
budget, while the composition of on-budget
support will shift towards non-security spending
as implementation of donor-funded development
projects improves.



The overall current account balance is expected to deteriorate in step with the projected decline
of donor aid, turning into deficit possibly as early as 2018.



Given the challenging economic environment and the pressures on the foreign exchange market
in late 2015, DAB is cautious about accumulating foreign reserves over the medium term. Thus,
the macro framework envisages gross international reserves to be flat at the existing
comfortable level of US$6.9 billion (almost nine months of 2017 imports).

13.
The overall budget including grants is set to remain broadly balanced, while the
operating deficit excluding grants is set to decline over the medium term.


In 2016, domestic revenues are projected to increase to 10.3 percent of GDP reflecting the full
year effect of revenue measures introduced in mid-2015, while budget grants are projected to
increase by about 2.6 percent of GDP on account of a re-phasing from 2015. Operating budget
execution is projected to pick up in 2016, with operating spending reaching 20 percent of GDP,
while development budget execution is expected to increase only modestly, due to capacity
constraints in planning and execution, with development spending projected at 7.5 percent of

GDP. The treasury’s discretionary cash balance is expected to remain above the indicative target
of Af 10 billion (0.8 percent of GDP).


By 2021, domestic revenues are projected to increase to 12.3 percent of GDP on account of
ongoing and new administrative and nontax measures (MEFP ¶21) as well as CASA transit fees.11
Operating spending is expected at around 20 percent of GDP over the medium term as security
outlays and non-security recurrent costs remain high, and pro-poor operating spending is
maintained above 3 percent of GDP.12 Development spending is projected to increase by
1.5 percentage points of GDP with reform-driven improvements in development budget
execution (MEFP ¶25) and an increase in discretionary development spending in line with higher
revenues. The 2017 budget will include a transfer to the Kabul Bank Receivership (0.3 percent of
GDP), and 2018–2019 budget balances are projected to record a small surplus to meet the
remaining obligations under the promissory note issued to DAB (MEFP ¶28).

Risks
14.
This outlook is subject to significant risks (Annex I). If security conditions worsen, aid
falls short, or migrant outflows accelerate, exchange rate pressures could re-emerge, and growth
would decelerate with attendant effects on unemployment. On the other hand, lasting peace
provides an upside to the medium-term trajectory because it would boost private sector confidence
and facilitate a growth-friendly shift in public spending from security to development.

THE AUTHORITIES’ PROGRAM
A. Broad Strategic Issues
16.
The authorities are working on a development strategy that sets a roadmap for reform
over the next several years, and are seeking development partners’ assistance to jump-start
11

These are cautious projections pending tax policy measures to be identified through technical assistance.

Spending on “ghost” public workers, pensioners, and projects is to be reduced through advancements in the
electronic payment systems and procurement processes.
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

the economy while preserving macro-financial stability. The authorities see the troop withdrawal
and rising insecurity as the main reasons for the recent sharp slowdown in growth, which in turn has
put upward pressure on unemployment and poverty, and contributed to the alienation of poorer
segments of the population. These dynamics undermine efforts to secure peace and may stimulate
emigration, creating a downward spiral. While peace and political stability are critical to achieving
sustainable and inclusive growth, addressing Afghanistan’s economic problems needs to go handin-hand with the resolution of the political-security problems: not only because low growth feeds
the insurgency and emigration, but also because prospects of, and a timeline for, resolving these
problems remain highly uncertain.
17.
A Fund-supported arrangement could play a catalytic role and would focus on the
Fund’s areas of comparative advantage. In a context where donors provide the bulk of financial
and capacity building support, the Fund should take the lead in providing a macroeconomic
framework and helping with fiscal reforms and strengthening the financial sector, while relying on
development partners in other areas. This division of labor calls for close coordination with
authorities, donors, and IFIs, which promotes ownership of the reform agenda by the authorities and
major stakeholders.

B. Design of the Program
18.
The program will rest on two pillars: structural reforms for private sector led growth,
and policies for macroeconomic and financial stability. Reviving growth requires a critical mass
of structural reforms that address numerous structural obstacles to growth (Annex II). At the same
time, the potential to boost demand directly through fiscal or monetary stimulus is very limited.
While reserve buffers are relatively strong, transmission channels are impaired. A fiscal stimulus in
the form of a debt-driven infrastructure investment program would be fraught with risks given the
limited capacity to carry and manage debt, the history of corruption and need for strong
complementary policies, yet likely ineffective in boosting growth and employment. A monetary
stimulus would likely be ineffective in this highly dollarized economy with the credit channel not
functioning properly and risking further capital outflows.
19.
Program conditionality will concentrate on areas of the Fund’s comparative advantage
to complement policies supported by development partners in other areas.


To facilitate private sector development in order to boost jobs and growth, mutually reinforcing
reforms will target a subset of the growth inhibitors, including weak institutional structures in
the fiscal area and endemic corruption. These reforms would create better conditions for the
private sector to play its role as engine of growth.



To preserve macroeconomic and financial stability, policies will aim to put underlying fiscal and
external imbalances on a downward trajectory while maintaining strong buffers. The budget will
favor development spending while maintaining fiscal sustainability (revenue mobilization,
expenditure rationalization, and improving budget execution). Financial sector policies will aim
to clean up the banking system in a durable way, strengthen vulnerable and weak banks and

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

reform the SOCBs. Ensuring effective implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating
the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime is also important to preserve the integrity and
stability of the financial system. Monetary policy will focus on price stability and a flexible
exchange rate regime in the context of high dollarization.
20.
The program internalizes the lessons from the mixed track record of past IMFsupported and staff-monitored programs (Annex III). Between 2004 and 2011, Afghanistan went
through a two-year SMP, and PRGF and ECF-supported programs, with the ECF-supported program
going off-track after the first review. Key problems were a lack of ownership and unrealistic
underlying assumptions. But the performance under the 2015 SMP was good, demonstrating the
authorities’ willingness and capacity to undertake sound policies and providing the track record for
a financial arrangement.

C. First Pillar: Structural Reform Priorities
Fiscal Reforms
21.
Structural fiscal reforms should contribute to reducing aid dependence and addressing
pressing social and infrastructure needs. Revenue collection remains far below potential,13 while
development needs are large, pro-poor spending is low and economy-wide capital spending is
declining. The budget is too inaccurate and opaque to serve as a useful tool for fiscal policy. The tax
administration lacks the capacity to deal with a largely noncompliant and unidentified taxpayer
population and there is a need to develop a tax policy framework that matches the capacity of both
the tax administration and the business community. Structural fiscal reforms will thus aim at
boosting revenues, strengthening budget planning, execution, and commitment control processes
to improve the quality and efficiency of public spending, and management of cash.
22.
On the revenue side, reforms will focus on raising the intake through selective and
focused administrative and policy reforms in Afghan Revenue and Customs Departments
(ARD and ACD). The priorities include strengthening customs revenue collection control and
capacity on goods that cross the border and optimization of the current tax and non-tax policies
(MEFP ¶¶21–23).


To improve trader compliance and reduce corruption, ACD will update its risk management
policy to implement multi-criteria risk profiles in all border crossings and inland customs depots,
and staff and train its risk management unit to effectively identify and prioritize high-risk traders
and shipments for physical examination and post-release verification.



To improve revenue collection efficiency and reduce leakages, ARD and ACD will operationalize
an automated interface for information sharing between the tax and customs administration
systems (Standardized Integrated Tax Administration System, SIGTAS, and Automated Systems

13

Afghanistan’s revenue collection (10 percent of GDP) currently covers only half of its operating expenditures.
The World Bank estimates that improved enforcement and compliance could raise the intake to 14 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

for Customs Data, ASYCUDA) to make sure all significant businesses are filing income tax
returns. The automated information sharing will be rolled out gradually to include Afghanistan
Central Business Registry (ACBR) and Afghanistan Payments System (APS) to ensure better
taxpayer identification and compliance.


The authorities will also continue to implement their action plan to strengthen the capacity of
ARD and ACD with the help of capacity development and financial assistance from donors,
including the World Bank.



IMF technical assistance (TA) is planned in FY2017 to conduct a diagnostic study of the current
tax and nontax revenue system to unlock additional sources of revenue over the program period.
It would focus on reviewing exemptions and potential to introduce excises on select goods and
services such as beverages, tobacco and petroleum products, and automobiles.



In the meantime, the authorities plan to review and update a set of government fees to bring
them in line with the current service costs and introduce additional fees in selected services (an
estimated yield of 0.2 percent of GDP from 2017 onwards).



While the introduction of a VAT remains a medium-term objective, staff concurred that a VAT is
not feasible over the program period given technological and human capacity constraints in the
tax administration as documented by a recent World Bank diagnostic study.



Reform of the mining fiscal regime should be completed by end-2017 with the help of IMF TA to
ensure a sound and transparent fiscal regime for extractive industries in full compliance with
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) requirements is in place as the mining
sector develops, notwithstanding security challenges, infrastructure gaps, and low commodity
prices. Progress in this area will be monitored by a June 2017 structural benchmark that sets out
remedial steps towards compliance with EITI requirements (MEFP ¶24).

23.
On the expenditure side, priorities include improving formulation, execution, and
reporting of the budget; ensuring a pro-growth re-composition of public spending; and
strengthening commitment control and allotment processes to better manage cash and
improve transparency (MEFP ¶25).


To improve budget costing and align public spending with national priorities, the authorities will
cost existing policies/projects and identify available fiscal space for new policies/projects. In line
with the government’s pro-growth and pro-poor priorities, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will
issue indicative expenditure ceilings for three years (budget year plus two forward years) to line
ministries to develop a portfolio of costed development projects and forward estimates based
on these expenditure ceilings.



The sequencing plan for line ministries to undertake costing reviews of their existing policies will
be developed this year, and the authorities plan to have medium-term forward estimates
starting with priority sector ministries in the next 2–3 years and for all ministries by 2020.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN



The authorities have also adopted a policy of working towards a consolidated national budget
to integrate the operational and development budgets and systematically take account of
allocations needed for operation and maintenance of capital assets created under development
projects.



To improve development budget planning and execution, the authorities envisage a threepronged approach.
 First, they will establish a database to track information (total cost, year-wise required
funding, funding sources, expenditures incurred, and current implementation status) on
the 50 largest projects to monitor the performance of the development budget, secure
future allocations needed to complete the ongoing projects, and (in consultation with
donors) reallocate resources from low to high-performing projects.
 Second, they will ensure that no project is funded in the budget unless all preparatory steps
have been completed, establishing its readiness for implementation.
 Third, they will streamline the process of administrative clearances/approvals at various
stages of project implementation.
 In addition, the MOF is engaging with line ministries to enhance their budget execution
capacity, and with donors to increase flexibility of development projects funding.



To strengthen commitment control and cash management, high value and multi-year contractual
commitments should be tracked through the Afghanistan Financial Management Information
System (AFMIS) and in-year allotments to line ministries should be based on annual financial
plans submitted by them. These financial plans will inform the cash plan of the Treasury, which
will control payments by the line ministries during budget execution against their authorized
financial plans and pre-registered commitments.

Financial Sector Reforms
24.
Afghanistan needs to develop financial intermediation. In addition to preserving
financial stability, a key objective of the program is to help foster growth-friendly financial sector
policies, as the banking system's low loan-to-deposit ratio limits private sector growth. While the
SOCBs focus on the resolution of their pending issues, the most robust of the private banks have
room to expand prudently and gradually their loan portfolios and the range of funding techniques
that they offer to their customers, beyond the current over-reliance on overdrafts. The DAB will
adjust its communication with them and review regulations that might be overly demanding
(particularly regarding collateral requirements) to avoid discouraging intermediation even by the
strongest banks. Progress on judicial processes for collateral recovery is also a priority.
25.
The Afghan government is developing an ambitious "National Financial Inclusion
Strategy" with the World Bank’s assistance. It is expected to start at the national level by 2016Q3
and to be finalized towards end-2017. The strategy covers an "access to finance" agenda, including
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

for agriculture, where diverse grass root initiatives will be coordinated with the Agriculture
Development Fund to leverage their impact. The strategy will target an improvement in financial
sector infrastructure, introduce a wider range of financial instruments, facilitate financial
intermediation, and support innovative financing for the private sector. Key components of the
strategy will also include strengthening consumer protection, improving financial literacy, and
building capacity for the commercial banks' staff.
Governance Issues
26.
Anti-corruption measures are crucial to build trust and accountability, minimize
revenue leakages, and improve the business environment. The authorities have taken steps to
improve the anti-corruption framework. A presidential decree was issued in October 2014 to clarify
that the High Office of Oversight and Corruption (HOO)’s main functions are to administer the
regime of asset declaration by public officials instead of supervising and inspecting other
government agencies. A National Procurement Authority was established to strengthen
transparency and accountability of the procurement process. A High Council for Good Governance,
Justice, and Anti-Corruption, chaired by the President, was established earlier in 2016 to coordinate
the development of a national strategy on anti-corruption, facilitate inter-agency collaboration, and
consolidate anti-corruption enforcement efforts. Asset declarations of most top officials listed in
Article 154 of the Constitution14 were published in November 2015. In addition, a call center was set
up in the Attorney General Office (AGO) in May 2016 to receive citizens’ complaints related to
corruption.
27.
The legal framework for anti-corruption will be aligned with international standards as
well as enhance enforcement and improve transparency. The authorities have prepared a draft
Appendix 4 to the Criminal Law and a draft new law on anti-corruption and will submit the draft
legislation to parliament by end October 2016 (structural benchmark for the first review, MEFP ¶37)
and pursue its prompt adoption. The legislation aims, among others, to:
i)

Criminalize acts of corruption in line with the United Nations Convention against
Corruption (UNCAC); and,

ii)

Ensure that annual asset declaration requirements are extended to cover heads and
deputies of law enforcement agencies, customs and tax administrations, covering both
assets legally owned and beneficially owned, with proportionate and dissuasive
sanctions for non-compliance. For the aforementioned officials not listed in the
Constitution, their declarations will be available in a timely manner upon request to, at a
minimum, domestic law enforcement agencies and the Financial Intelligence Unit.

14

According to Article 154 of the Constitution, ”the wealth of the President, Vice-Presidents, Ministers, members of
the Supreme Court as well as the Attorney General, shall be registered, reviewed and published prior to and after
their term of office by an organ established by law.“

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

28.
Building upon these measures, the authorities plan to implement the strengthened
asset declaration regime. As a first step, they plan to publish by end-June 2017 the declarations for
2016 by officials listed in Article 154 of the Constitution in Dari and in English on an official website
freely available and easily searchable. The website will also include information in Dari and in English
on the name and functions of other senior officials mentioned above who have declared their assets
for the previous year, updated on an annual basis, and on the mechanisms to access their
declarations (structural benchmark for the 2nd review, MEFP ¶37).
Business Climate
29.
Strengthening the business climate is an important element of the government’s
broader reform strategy. Afghanistan is at the bottom decile of the World Bank Doing Business
index and faces significant challenges in areas such as licensing procedures, property registration,
resolving insolvency, enforcing contracts, getting credit and electricity, and trading across borders—
areas that empirical analysis15 shows are associated with spurring productivity growth in low-income
countries. Fund staff will support other donors, such as the World Bank, that are working with the
authorities to improve the business climate.

D. Second Pillar: Preserving Macro-Financial Stability
30.
Macro-financial stability requires strengthening fiscal and external balances while
maintaining strong buffers. With large underlying imbalances, macro stability has been
maintained with donor aid, but this is likely to decline over the medium term. Quantitative
performance criteria on a number of indicators (Appendix I, Table 1) will be used to monitor
progress.
31.
Over the medium term, the operating budget balance excluding grants should become
an anchor for fiscal policy. Currently, operating spending, and hence the operating balance before
grants, are affected by the unpredictable process of donors moving their support (activities and
financing, including security-related) on-budget, which results in hard-to-predict changes in the
indicator. Until it is possible to make this target fully operational, the overall budget balance
including grants should be maintained close to zero, keeping public debt low.
32.
The current monetary and exchange rate regime has served Afghanistan well. With
weak monetary transmission channels, reserve money will continue to be the nominal anchor for
monetary policy, with the objective of keeping inflation low; however, some pickup in inflation over
time is likely, with demand picking up before reforms elicit a supply response. The flexible exchange
rate regime should be maintained to facilitate the absorption of frequent shocks. The central bank
should aim to reduce dollarization and increase the use of the Afghani; this would strengthen
monetary policy transmission to the real economy. For that, low inflation and enhanced
communications by DAB to clarify its objectives and operations via regular publications are
15

Economies” https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2013/sdn1308.pdf.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

important elements. In addition, a broadening of the range of domestic currency-denominated
instruments to include sukuk should also help monetary operations.
33.
To consolidate financial stability, the authorities will complete the resolution of the
2010 Kabul Bank crisis (Annex IV). As a first step, the authorities will recapitalize the New Kabul
Bank (NKB) by end-December 2016 (structural benchmark) for an amount of US$91 million plus an
adequate amount of capital as determined by the Banking Law of Afghanistan (MEFP ¶29). Next,
the FY2017 budget will include an explicit allocation for a transfer to the Kabul Bank Receivership of
the funds that the MOF owes for the Kabul Bank assets taken over by various government entities
(structural benchmark, MEFP ¶28). By June 2017, these funds, together with other assets of the
receivership, will be applied to the reduction of DAB’s remaining lender-of-last-resort (LLRF)
exposure. Finally, starting in 2017 and by end-2019, the remaining LLRF balance on DAB’s books will
be fully eliminated with capital transfers. Thus, the DAB will be relieved from its lingering exposure
to the results of the liquidation of the Kabul Bank, while the New Kabul Bank will transition from a
temporary bridge bank without capital to a depositor-oriented, adequately capitalized institution.
The authorities continue to consider the future of the NKB, including its possible privatization.
34.
The three SOCBs will continue to give priority to prudent management while their
remaining serious governance shortcomings are being addressed resolutely by the
supervision department of DAB. The authorities started a dialogue with the World Bank to request
TA to align corporate governance of SOCBs with global best practices. During a transition period,
while all its identified weaknesses are addressed, NKB will not change its current lending policy.
Pashtany Bank, which has only recently recognized in its books the large losses on its loan portfolio
accumulated over the years, will focus on improving its governance and demonstrating its financial
viability before giving consideration to a resumption of its lending activities. In the meantime, the
Bad Debt Commission will pursue its mission. The authorities are also seeking the World Bank’s
support to enhance SOCBs’ efficiency through automation of major banking functions and
modernization of payment systems to minimize operational risks. The SOCBs‘ business model thus
temporarily consists of focusing on prudence, governance and efficiency.
35.
DAB will continue capacity building efforts in the area of prudential regulation and
supervision. The 2014–2018 Strategic Action Plan (SAP) developed with the Middle East Technical
Assistance Center is being implemented and will be further supported by a new World Bank project
under preparation and soon to be finalized. An update of the SAP will take place by mid-2017,
including incorporating a bank resolution framework. The special reviews of the weaker private
banks are progressing as expected and the results will become available during the 3rd quarter of
2016. Some IMF TA, targeted to support of the SAP implementation, has been requested in the area
of prudential regulations and stress-testing.
36.
Good progress has been made over the past two years in establishing a legal
framework for AML/CFT measures. The AML and CFT laws were amended in 2015 and a few
regulations were issued to implement them, including the CFT regulation, the regulation on currency
reporting at borders (as revised in December 2015), the Fit and Proper Regulation for banks (re-

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

issued under the Banking Law), and the AML and Proceeds of Crime Regulation–Preventive
Measures for Financial Institutions.
37.
The authorities plan to enhance implementation of the AML/CFT framework, in
particular the regulation on currency reporting at borders and the fit and proper regulation.
ACD has started implementing at the Kabul airport the revised regulation on currency reporting at
borders. To step up implementation in order to allow for detecting and deterring physical crossborder movement of illegal proceeds, ACD will, with DAB’s support, adopt a revised declaration
form template and working procedures and plan to publish quarterly implementation reports. DAB
will start implementing the Fit and Proper Regulation for the existing banks by completing collection
of relevant information from all banks by September 2016 (MEFP ¶39).
38.
Afghanistan has been subject to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s monitoring
since 2012 for its “strategic deficiencies” in the AML/CFT regime. The authorities are committed
to completing the action plan agreed with the FATF by September 2016 aiming at exiting FATF’s
monitoring process in February 2017.

PROGRAM MODALITIES
39.


Level of access, BOP need, capacity to repay:
The current and projected level of reserves is
deemed comfortable. As a result, there is no
immediate residual BOP need. However, there are
protracted BOP pressures over the medium term
reflecting underlying current account
imbalances.16 In addition, high aid dependence
and the risk of renewed outflows resulting from
emigration, call for an adequate level of foreign
reserves.

Program performance will be monitored through quantitative performance criteria and
indicative targets similar to the 2015 SMP as well as structural benchmarks (Appendix I).

40.
Financial assurances and donor support. Aid flows in the next few years are likely to be
maintained at or near the current levels, with a shift toward on-budget financing and strengthened
conditionality to ensure results. Donors would welcome the Fund’s continuing engagement through
a financial arrangement, seeing the Fund as a catalyst both for advancing the reform agenda and for
building confidence and support ahead of the October 2016 donor conference.
41.
Afghanistan’s capacity development needs are substantial. A number of TA missions to
strengthen fiscal reforms and policies, financial sector policies, and the quality of macroeconomic
statistics have been delivered by the Fund in recent years, complementing important efforts by
international donors. IMF missions have been conducted off-site given weak security, which limited
their effectiveness. Going forward, and to support policies and reforms under the ECF arrangement,
TA delivery will need to be ramped up, including in the financial (supervision, bank restructuring),
fiscal (revenue administration, tax policy, and public financial management), and macroeconomic
and financial statistics areas. Close coordination with the donor community—especially those
present on the ground—will be important in delivering some of the TA and assessing program
implementation.
42.
The Fund-supported program can proceed under the new policy on non-toleration of
arrears to official creditors.17 Afghanistan owes a small amount (US$10 million) of pre-HIPC
Initiative arrears to a non-Paris Club creditor, which continue to be deemed away under the revised
arrears policy for official creditors, as the underlying Paris Club agreement was adequately
representative and the authorities have made best efforts to resolve the arrears. Staff will follow up
on this issue in future reviews.
43.
The most recent safeguards assessment of DAB was finalized in 2011 against
the background of the Kabul Bank fraud, which had impacted DAB’s financial position.
The recommendation related to the recapitalization of DAB through a government promissory note
at that time has been implemented, but some lingering DAB exposure to this incident still needs to
be addressed. DAB will resume publishing on its website the Kabul Bank receivership’s annual
financial statements audited by an international audit firm. Controls in some safeguards areas have
also improved, but capacity constraints remain an issue. Amending the DAB law has proven
a challenge, and, as a result, the recommendation concerning the DAB’s legal structure remains
outstanding. With a new program, an updated safeguards assessment of DAB will need to be
conducted ahead of the first review, and is expected to take place at an offsite location for security
reasons. Recommendations will be taken up in future reviews, as necessary.

STAFF APPRAISAL
44.
Afghanistan is facing difficult challenges and remains fragile and heavily aid
dependent. Political uncertainties and insecurity, international troop drawdown, and weak
institutional capacity have weighed on economic performance and social outcomes. To reverse
these trends, the national unity government is looking for ways to transform the ailing economy to
achieve durable and inclusive growth. The authorities recognize that better economic performance
requires sustained reforms as well as improved security conditions.
45.
The economic outlook remains highly dependent on political and security stability,
steadfast reform efforts, and donor support. Growth has declined sharply in the past few years,
reaching only 0.8 percent last year. In 2016, a modest pickup to 2 percent is expected, and over
the medium term, assuming political stability and implementation of good policies, growth should
gradually rise to the 4–6 percent range. Downside risks to this scenario are significant, and relate
mostly to deterioration in security conditions and shortfalls in donor aid. On the upside, a lasting
improvement in security conditions would provide a game changing boost to confidence and
the economy.
46.
Against this background, the authorities are seeking the international community’s
support for their reform agenda aimed at moving towards self-reliance. A long and challenging
reform agenda lies ahead and the authorities seek the Fund’s support through a three-year ECF
arrangement. The Fund-supported program would catalyze continued donor support by providing a
macroeconomic framework anchor and a time bound roadmap for reform. The program’s structural
reforms focus on areas of the Fund’s comparative advantage and are complementary to reforms
supported by donors and partner IFIs.
47.
The authorities’ new Fund-supported program addresses the challenges at hand, in the
broader context of Afghanistan’s National Development Framework. Over the next three years,
the program will aim to support a rebound in growth, modest inflation, and low public debt with a
comfortable international reserves buffer. To this end, the program put forward by the authorities
rests on two pillars—first, structural reforms to facilitate private sector development, and second,
policies aimed at preserving macroeconomic and financial stability.
48.
A strong fiscal structural reform effort is essential. In particular, determined efforts are
needed to raise the revenue intake through selective and focused administrative and policy reforms
in the revenue and custom departments; improve formulation, execution, and reporting of
the budget; ensure a pro-growth composition of public spending; and strengthen commitment
control and cash management. Establishing a strong fiscal anchor and gradually expanding the fiscal
perimeter should be important development objectives under the program.
49.
Strong anti-corruption measures are critical to boost stakeholders’ confidence, and
prepare the ground for economic recovery. The authorities need to strengthen the legal and
institutional framework for anti-corruption to ensure that acts of corruption are criminalized in line

with the UNCAC, and focus AGO’s anti-corruption directorates and the special anti-corruption court
on investigating, prosecuting and convicting perpetrators of these offences. The regime for asset
declaration by public officials and publication of declarations, supported by strong implementation
and enforcement, should be strengthened further, being a critical tool in improving transparency
and accountability of the public sector.
50.
Financial sector reforms to durably clean up the banking sector will be critical to
banking system stability and to economic development. While there has been progress in bank
supervision, regulation, and legislation, financial stability and DAB’s regulatory and supervisory
frameworks require further bolstering to address the remaining issues (including risk-based
supervision, implementation of AML/CFT measures, and consolidated supervision). The authorities
should closely monitor financial risks given rising NPLs and weak profitability. They will also need to
proceed with the allocation of the burden inherited from the 2010 Kabul Bank crisis, restoring DAB’s
balance sheet and NKB’s solvency position.
51.
Staff commends the progress made by Afghanistan in strengthening the AML/CFT
framework. Nonetheless, implementation needs to be stepped up to protect financial stability and
enable effective detection and deterrence of illegal proceeds from corruption and other macrocritical economic crimes such as illicit drug production and trafficking. The authorities are also urged
to take actions promptly in order to exit the FATF’s monitoring process.
52.
The program’s policy mix is aimed at preserving macro-financial stability. The overall
fiscal balance after grants is targeted to remain close to zero, preventing a build-up in public debt.
Over time, the operating balance before grants should become the fiscal policy anchor, with
the program targeting a declining deficit over the medium term. Monetary policy is programmed to
deliver moderate inflation, while fostering confidence in the domestic currency. The flexible
exchange rate regime is a shock absorber and has served Afghanistan well and should remain in
place.
53.
The authorities should make progress in strengthening the quality and timeliness of
economic data. Reliable statistics are critical for sound economic policy-making. TA from the Fund
is available to support this effort.
54.
The proposed program would carry substantial implementation risks. The fragile
security situation and political uncertainty could undermine reform implementation and derail
the program, as could governance gaps and a lack of transparency. Expectations must therefore
remain realistic: there are likely to be setbacks, making recovery and achieving self-reliance, the
authorities’ ultimate goal, an extended process. While major donors have expressed their intention
to continue aid at or near current levels, others have taken a more cautious position and may
choose to exit if reforms stall.
55.
Hence, strong program ownership will be critical. The Fund-supported program can play
an important role in supporting the government’s reform agenda, but experience in Afghanistan and
elsewhere shows that successful programs typically have broad based buy-in from key stakeholders.

Annex II. What Ails Afghanistan’s Economy?
1.
Afghanistan has seen a sharp drop in growth in recent years. Growth has collapsed in
recent years, dropping from an average of 11½ percent in 2007–12 to 1½ percent in 2013–15 as
the size of the International Security Assistance Force stationed in the country fell from 130,000 to
13,000, compounded by political uncertainty and rising insecurity. The withdrawal of international
troops led to a sharp decline in in-country military spending and related demand spillovers to the
broader economy (see charts below), which have led to significant job losses. Thus, growth in
Afghanistan is now too low to absorb the estimated 400,000 labor market entrants each year, with
unemployment already at 23 percent and the poverty rate at 36 percent as of 2011 and probably
higher now.

Annex III. Lessons from the Ex Post Assessment1
1.
Afghanistan has previously engaged in two Fund-supported programs that aimed at
establishing macroeconomic stability and laying foundations for structural reforms. Both
programs faced the challenges of dealing with unprecedented inflows of international aid and
scaling up of public investment against the background of increasing insecurity. Two Staff
Monitored Programs were also put in place, in 2004-06 and, most recently, in 2015.
2.
The June 2006 PRGF-supported arrangement was a vehicle to implement a broad
structural reform agenda and access debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative on the back of a 24-month SMP. The program aimed at solidifying
macroeconomic stability and creating conditions for private sector-led development. To this end, it
aimed at sustaining real GDP growth of about 10 percent a year, reducing inflation to 5 percent,
further strengthening the external position, and accelerating institutional and structural reforms,
such as improvements to the fiscal and monetary policy frameworks, restructuring of state-owned
banks, and improvement of the business environment. All six reviews were completed; a request for
an ECF-supported arrangement was made in July of 2010.
3.
The November 2011 ECF-supported arrangement was approved against a background
of the impending drawdown of international troops, the 2012 Tokyo donor conference, and
the Kabul Bank crisis. The overarching objective was to maintain macroeconomic stability as the
troop withdrawal necessitated higher domestic security spending and smaller projected aid was
expected to lower growth. A staff-level agreement was reached in 2010; however, the program was
quickly recast in light of the Kabul Bank crisis, aiming at strengthening financial sector supervision
and overall economic governance, and improving the transparency and efficiency of public
spending. The first review was completed in June 2012 but the subsequent ones were delayed due
to missed quantitative targets and slow implementation of structural reforms, with the program
going off-track.
4.
While there were notable successes, both programs fell short of their initial goals.
Macroeconomic stability was maintained and some key reforms were advanced, but many others
were left unfinished, including fiscal reforms. While foreign aid played a critical role in stabilizing
the economy, significant aid-financed off-budget spending by donors contributed to the buildup of
a better-paid “parallel” civil service, demotivating the regular civil service and weakening program
ownership.
5.
A new program with the Fund is likely to carry substantial risks, related primarily to
weak security and governance gaps. But with long-term aid inflows set to decline to a lower level,
Fund engagement can help manage the transition to reduced aid by maintaining macroeconomic

stability and helping retain donor support. Past lessons that can improve the effectiveness of future
program engagement include:


Basing the macro framework on more realistic assumptions of aid flows and security and other
expenditures;



Focusing on macro-critical structural reforms while giving explicit consideration to the
implementation capacity of the authorities;



Strengthening coordination of policies and capacity building efforts;



Improving governance including by strengthening targeted AML/CFT and anti-corruption
measures; and,



Increasing reliance on the Afghan civil service for public service delivery; promoting ownership
of the reform agenda by key stakeholders.

Annex IV. The Kabul Bank Crisis:
Completing the Burden Allocation Process
1.
The Kabul Bank fraud in 2010 severely damaged the credibility of Afghanistan’s
banking sector and of its supervisory framework. At that time, the Kabul Bank had the largest
branch network in the country and accounted for one third of domestic banking assets. The crisis
emerged in September 2010 when media reports of massive lending abuses led to a large scale run
on its deposits.
2.
The authorities reacted quickly and decisively to contain the run. The authorities
guaranteed all of the Kabul Bank’s deposits. The DAB put the bank into conservatorship, and
through its lender-of-last-resort facility (LLRF) met US$825 million of deposit withdrawals. In the
spring of 2011, the bank was moved to receivership, after seventy percent of its total assets (almost
US$1 billion) appeared doubtful. All remaining deposits (US$586 million, per the audited financial
statements for the period ended December 31, 2011) and assets (US$567 million, ditto) deemed to
be of good quality were transferred to the New Kabul Bank (NKB), an entity granted regulatory
forbearance to act as a bridge bank without any capital and expected to be sold within 18 months.
In 2012, DAB’s LLRF exposure was underwritten by a Ministry of Finance (MOF) interest-bearing
Promissory Note with a quarterly repayment schedule.
3.
Five years later, the burden allocation process remains incomplete. Staff estimates the
total financing needed to complete the process at US$571 million and identified resources at
US$239 million. In absence of other resources, the remaining balance of US$332 million
(1.8 percent of forecasted 2016 GDP) could be raised via a financial instrument issued by the
Government.
Receivership: As of April 2016, total recoveries and settlements have reached US$362 million
(including US$203 million in cash, used to repay part of the LLRF balance and cover administrative
costs) and is due to receive a further US$33 million of fully collateralized receivables under new
agreements with Kabul Bank’s borrowers. The process, however, is now losing steam. Some of the
remaining claims (amounting to US$658 million and including US$512 million owed by two former
shareholders) targeted by the receivership are in foreign jurisdictions, pursued through legal and
diplomatic channels with diminishing chances of success. The government has still to pay
US$50 million for assets purchased from the receivership in 2013–14 (including US$24 million for
airplanes and US$13 million for fuel facilities). The receivership currently has US$31 million in cash
on its accounts. The government has taken responsibility for the final losses if not recovered.
NKB: Efforts to privatize the NKB have not been successful. It is now close to operating with costs
fully covered but has accumulated over the years operating losses of US$50 million. Its balance
sheet also includes commitments to receive the proceeds of recoveries from the failed Kabul Bank
that did not materialize in full, a shortage valued at US$41 million at end-2015. Finally, if the NKB
were to continue functioning as a bank, it would need to be allocated a minimum capital of
US$15 million (AF 1 billion) as determined by the Banking Law of Afghanistan.

DAB: Since 2014, the Promissory Note repayment schedule has not been adhered to, and, with
interest accruing, the outstanding LLRF balance started to rise again, reaching US$415 million at end
2015. This amount should be brought down in 2016-17 through payments from the MOF and
the receivership, and the remainder should be fully repaid as quickly as possible and in any case by
the end of 2019 at the latest.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Kabul, June 30, 2016
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
Much progress has been made by the Afghan government and its people with strong support from
the international community, yet we continue to face difficult security, economic, and political
challenges that threaten to undermine our achievements. Nevertheless, our government is
determined to press ahead with reforms needed to address the difficult challenges Afghanistan
faces and build prosperity for current and future generations of Afghans.
We would like to thank the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its support in recent years,
including in the context of the staff-monitored program (SMP), which was successfully completed
and the last review of which was concluded in April. This demonstrated our commitment to sound
policies and reform. Having addressed the immediate fiscal and banking vulnerabilities by
mobilizing revenues and strengthening financial sector supervision and enforcement, we would now
like to build on this by laying the foundations for a vibrant economy through macroeconomic
stability and structural reforms promoting sustainable and inclusive growth. Indeed, we must plan
for a future where we will have put behind us dependence on donor aid, even if this new reality will
take decades to arrive at.
As we embark on this difficult path and in support of our reform agenda, we request a three-year
IMF Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement, covering the period July 20, 2016 to July 19, 2019, in
an amount equivalent to SDR 32.38 million (10 percent of Afghanistan’s quota). Such an
arrangement would play a critical catalytic role, and be embedded in a broader multi-year
development strategy that sets us on a path of self-reliance.
The Government of Afghanistan believes that the policies set forth in the attached Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) are adequate to achieve the objectives of its program, but it
will take any further measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. We will consult with
the IMF on the adoption of these measures and in advance of any revision to the policies contained
in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation. We intend to remain in
close consultation with Fund staff and provide timely information necessary for monitoring
economic developments and implementation of policies under the ECF-supported program.

In line with our commitment to transparency, we hereby request that the staff report, this letter of

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
for 2016–2019
A. Introduction
1.
This memorandum reviews the recent economic developments and lays out our
economic objectives and policy framework for the period through July 19, 2019, for which we
are seeking support under a three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement with IMF
staff.
2.
Afghanistan’s nine-month Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) ended in December 2015.
The second review of the SMP was completed by IMF management in April 2016. Despite difficult
circumstances, we have implemented the program successfully and on schedule: all end-December
quantitative targets and most structural benchmarks were met. The requirements of two unmet
benchmarks were completed by the end of the SMP through approval of related regulations.
3.
We are committed to reinvigorate economic reform and address structural weaknesses
in the economy. We have started to address economic vulnerabilities and would like to press ahead
with the reform program through a series of policy and legislative actions. These actions signal our
commitment to reform, building economic confidence, and raising economic growth.
4.
The ECF arrangement will support our macroeconomic policy and reform agenda for
2016–19. It will help the government address economic vulnerabilities and facilitate our
engagement with the international community to sustain donor support and help us make progress
on the deliverables under the Self-Reliance Mutual Accountability Framework (SMAF). The ECF
arrangement will assist us to preserve macroeconomic stability, improve economic governance, and
lay the basis for stronger private sector activity.

B. Recent Economic Developments
5.
Economic activity continues to be weak. Following the withdrawal of the international
troops, growth continued to decline in 2015, reaching 0.8 percent. Uncertainties related to
security and political transition sapped private sector confidence and reduced domestic demand.
Growth was driven by the services sector, with both industrial and agricultural output declining.
Inflation averaged -1.5 percent in 2015 on account of low global oil and food prices, a suppressed
housing market, and weak demand. However, inflation turned positive in late 2015, following a
sharp depreciation of the Afghani (in a de facto floating exchange rate regime), and has continued
to rise in 2016. International reserves remained comfortable and since early 2016 the exchange rate
has been broadly stable. The external current account and budget continued to be financed by
donor grants.
6.
On the fiscal side, 2015 was marked by a remarkable turnaround in domestic revenue.
After declining for three consecutive years, domestic revenue increased by about 20 percent

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

(1½ percentage points of GDP) in 2015. This was achieved despite the growth slowdown, and
reflected the revenue measures introduced earlier in the year (0.4 percent of GDP), and, more
importantly, increased collection efficiency, including of tax and nontax arrears (0.7 percent of GDP).
On the expenditure side, operating budget execution was below projections. Together, this resulted
in a lower-than-targeted operating deficit before grants. However, the overall balance including
grants was in deficit of 1.4 percent of GDP, rather than zero as projected earlier, due to a shortfall in
grants.
7.
The President has tasked the Ministry of Finance to facilitate a five-year rolling
program of reforms to public financial management with an emphasis on improving
performance by teams moving towards the goal of self-reliance. The first rolling five-year plan
for the 2015–19 period (Implementation of the Public Financial Management Roadmap II) sets out
detailed major actions for each team within the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and within other technical
agencies including the National Procurement Agency and the Afghanistan Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (AEITI) Secretariat to be implemented under a performance management
system. The ultimate goal is more effective and efficient investment of public money through a
budget that is more responsive to the priorities of the government and more accountable to the
Afghan public and the donors.
8.
While the inaugural five-year plans have set out a vision for future, many reforms are
already under way. We implemented substantial reforms in tax and customs administrations to
improve enforcement and compliance, and to reduce leakages with the help of World Bank technical
assistance. We dismissed forty corrupt or inefficient senior staff in the revenue (ARD) and customs
(ACD) departments. We transferred the customs police from the Ministry of Interior to the MOF to
improve customs enforcement, and approved a human resource reform policy, including
establishment of a customs academy, to improve staff professionalism. We upgraded our
Automated Systems for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) and made greater use of its functionality, and
adopted several technological processes. We operationalized large and medium taxpayer offices,
and rolled out our Standardized Integrated Tax Administration System (SIGTAS) in five large
provinces. We also introduced risk-based compliance audits in all taxpayer offices in Kabul.
9.
Revenue, budget execution, and the treasury cash balance continued to improve in
2016. In the first five months of 2016, revenue increased by 0.7 percent of GDP to 4.3 percent of
GDP (Af 55.5 billion) compared to the same period last year, reflecting the measures introduced in
2015. Although development budget execution has not performed as planned due largely to delays
in procurement and submission of invoices by budgetary units, operating budget execution
exceeded last year’s performance owing to acceleration in procurement in the security sector and a
pick-up in wage and pension payments. The donor grants more than financed the overall budget,
which recorded a surplus of about 2.5 percent of GDP, and the treasury’s discretionary cash balance
increased to 2.5 percent of GDP, equivalent to 1.5 months of operating spending.
10.
The financial sector remains vulnerable to adverse shocks. Asset quality remains a
concern, nonperforming loans have increased, and profitability is under pressure. We have put
fragile private banks under a watchful monitoring regime and the Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB)
50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

supervision directorate continues to monitor closely the weaker private banks. As part of a special
review program, DAB is conducting in-depth examinations of each of them, issuing numerous
corrective orders and injunctions, and will produce a comprehensive report on the results obtained
upon completion of the exercise, expected by the third quarter of 2016, with necessary actions taken
as needed.
11.
We have made some progress in improving the financial position of the state-owned
commercial banks (SOCBs). One of them remains profitable, while the breakeven point for the two
others seems to be within reach in 2016. The capital adequacy of two of them has improved but the
third one, the New Kabul Bank (NKB), remains in a precarious solvency situation that we are now
addressing as an urgent priority. The two expressions of interest for its privatization received by the
March 7 deadline have been both assessed as less than satisfactory and we are reassessing our
strategy with regards to resolving the issues around this bank (see below). We have continued our
efforts to advance the Kabul Bank liquidation and asset recovery and are taking additional steps to
improve the transparency of the process.
12.
Support from our international partners remains vital. Aid flows help to meet
immediate financing requirements and reduce fiscal vulnerability. Further, the London
Ministerial Conference in December 2014 reconfirmed our international partners’ commitment to
finance our security and development needs, and we look forward to a renewal of commitments at
the Warsaw Summit and Brussels Conference this year. Afghanistan’s National Development
Framework (ANDF) makes explicit the government’s goals of weaning the country away from aid
dependency. Achieving this goal requires a collective effort to overcome fragmentation, defeat
corruption, and introduce proper policies for sustainable growth. However, we also draw attention
to the risks attendant in overly rapid or not well thought through reductions in support for the
reform agenda. We believe that the sequencing described in this framework will succeed in
achieving its objectives, but a pre-condition for its success is sustaining the partnerships that are still
needed to embed the reforms and follow them through.

C. Economic Program for 2016–2019
13.
Our program will seek to create conditions for higher, more inclusive, growth through
structural reforms, while maintaining macro-financial stability. The macroeconomic policy mix
will maintain policy buffers, low inflation and public debt, and protect competitiveness. Fiscal policy
will support growth by mobilizing domestic revenue and catalyzing continued donor support to
finance projected higher security and development expenditure, settle arrears, maintain the
treasury’s cash balance, while avoiding debt accumulation. Monetary policy will aim to preserve low
inflation and we will continue with the flexible exchange rate regime to protect the international
reserves position and competitiveness. The structural reform agenda will focus on: (i) fiscal reforms
to boost revenue and the quality of spending; (ii) strengthening the financial sector and its
contribution to growth; and (iii) fighting corruption. In addition, we will pursue reforms that
strengthen the business climate in collaboration with our international partners, especially the World
Bank.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

14.
We are cautiously optimistic about 2016, but there are downside risks. Growth is
expected to recover as political transition uncertainties subside, reforms advance, and confidence
recovers. With sustained reform and donor support, growth is projected to increase further in
2017 and beyond, and inflation to remain in single digits. However, while we continue to invest
heavily in the peace process, continued uncertainty about the security situation will keep on
restraining private demand and is a significant source of downside risk.
15.
Poverty reduction remains an important priority. Our policies are guided by the ANDF as
well as the paper we prepared for the London Conference on Afghanistan Realizing Self-Reliance.
They focus on low inflation, pro-poor budgeting, and inclusive economic growth propelled by
investment in agriculture, more regional economic integration, the fight against corruption, and
greater gender equality. Although security outlays will increase, we will allocate adequate resources
to increase opportunities for the poor. A Jobs for Peace program has already been rolled out and is
showing results. The first phase of the program has created over 2.6 million labor days above and
beyond already planned program activities, providing over half a million families living in rural areas
with crucial cash inputs over the late winter months, when food insecurity is at its most severe. The
second phase of the program is currently being launched and will include both a scale-up of the
rural program to cover the remaining provinces and the introduction of a labor based clean-up
program in Afghanistan's five largest cities, with an initial target of 10,000 new jobs. To monitor
results, we will continue to improve the collection and analysis of poverty indicators. Pro-poor
operating spending in 2016 is programmed to be Af 36.6 billion (about 3 percent of GDP).
Macroeconomic Policies
16.
Our macroeconomic policy framework is designed to preserve macroeconomic
stability and promote growth. It will target a pick-up in GDP growth to 4 percent over the next
three years and inflation in single digits. It will also maintain buffers of low debt (less than
10 percent of GDP) and a comfortable international reserves position (above 7 months of import
cover). It will protect competitiveness, with the current account in surplus or modest deficit after
grants. We will target overall budget balance after grants, but over time the operating balance
excluding grants will become the fiscal anchor. Reserve money remains the monetary anchor, with a
view to maintaining moderate inflation. We will remain dependent on donor support to meet our
fiscal and external financing needs, which is expected to decline in percent of GDP.
17.
We expect a balanced overall budget in 2016 after grants, and will maintain a prudent
fiscal position in 2017 and beyond. Domestic revenue is projected to increase to 10.3 percent of
GDP (Af 132.6 billion) this year reflecting the full-year effect of revenue measures introduced in mid2015. Adjusting for the large one-off collections in 2015, this reflects an increase of about
0.8 percent of GDP. Budget grants are projected to increase by about 2.6 percent of GDP on account
of a re-phasing from 2015. We expect operating spending to pick up, after an unusually low
operating budget execution in 2015, especially in the defense sector. We expect the treasury’s
discretionary cash balance to remain well above the indicative target in the program (Af 10 billion).
We project a limited increase in development budget execution due to ongoing difficulties with
unrealistic over-budgeting of multi-year grant-financed projects. Our reform efforts over the coming
52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

years will target quantifiable improvements in the credibility of the development budget and raising
its execution rate. For 2017, we will submit to parliament by end-November (structural benchmark) a
budget that is in line with the macroeconomic framework of the ECF-supported program. We will
continue to target a gradual decline in the operating deficit excluding grants and a zero overall
balance including grants. Our program aims to mobilize additional revenue for growth-enhancing
development spending and to continue the long process of reducing aid dependence. Projections
for domestic revenue over the program period are cautious pending identification of tax policy and
administration measures with the help of our international partners, including the IMF. We will only
borrow on a highly concessional basis for specific projects in consultation with international
partners. We will set aside any revenues earned from extraordinary currency exchange gains for
building the government’s cash reserves and will not allocate these gains in the budget for spending
by budgetary units.
18.
We plan to carefully manage money growth, continue exchange rate flexibility, and
safeguard international reserves. Reserve money will continue to be the operational target for
monetary policy, with the objective of containing inflation to 4–8 percent. Reserve money growth of
10 percent is projected for 2016. Our program envisages a moderate increase in net international
reserves (about US$50 million) and international reserve cover will remain above 6 months of
imports during the term of the arrangement. We will let the Afghani move with market trends and
only intervene to avoid excessive exchange rate volatility. We remain committed to an independent
central bank that sets monetary policy with a view to maintaining moderate inflation and managing
prudently shocks or persistent changes in foreign exchange flows. We will improve coordination
between DAB and the MOF to strengthen the conduct of monetary policy, facilitate fiscal cash
management, and promote market development by finalizing legislation to set up a sukuk (Sharia
compliant treasury bill) market with a view to submit the bill for parliamentary approval within six
months after completion of the necessary technical assistance work by the IMF or the World Bank.
Structural Reforms
19.
We will reinvigorate structural reforms. Fiscal reforms have been set out in detail in the
government’s five-year rolling Fiscal Performance Improvement Plan and will focus on improving the
performance of teams delivering core budget functions. Flagship reforms include strengthening
priority setting by Cabinet through improved forecasts, establishment of rolling forward estimates
with robust costing of existing policy, streamlined budget management with improved program and
project preparation to reduce over-budgeting and carryovers, improved cash management and
accounting and increased accountability through improved annual reporting and audit. The reforms
will also gradually be extended to key line ministries over the course of the next few years focusing
on improved budget credibility, better budget execution and annual reports comparing outcomes to
budgets. We will further approve regulations that will lay the basis for public private partnerships to
finance key projects and initiatives that will create jobs and contribute to economic growth. The
financial statements will be annually audited and published by the Supreme Audit Office no later
than twelve months after the end of a fiscal year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

20.
Financial sector reforms will focus on turning the page on the Kabul Bank collapse and
its legacies, dealing with weak banks, and further strengthening bank supervision. With regard
to economic governance, our reforms focus on strengthening the legal and institutional framework
to combat corruption and enhancing implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime. In addition, as outlined in the ANDF, we will focus on
supporting a business enabling environment by improving access to credit, reducing red tape,
improving infrastructure, and implementing regulatory reforms (for example, creating a level playing
field for private and state enterprises).
Fiscal Reforms
21.
After our successful efforts in 2015, we will continue to implement policies and
reforms that help mobilize revenue. Given weak economic conditions, we do not plan additional
tax policy measures in 2016, and will instead focus on further improving tax administration.
Nevertheless, we believe that further revenue potential exists, and will therefore conduct a
diagnostic study of our tax and nontax revenue systems with the help of IMF TA with a focus on
reducing exemptions, and expanding the revenue base by introducing excises on select goods and
services. In 2017, we plan to raise selected government fees, which have not been updated for
several years. We estimate that revisions to a basket of nontax revenue sources could yield about
Af 2.5 billion revenue (0.2 percent of GDP) in 2017 and beyond. We are reviewing the current
Income Tax Law, and will propose amendments aimed at simplifying the law and reducing tax
evasion in consultation with the IMF and the World Bank staff. We expect these amendments to
improve the equity and efficiency of our tax system. Finally, we believe that a VAT is needed and its
introduction is an important part of our medium-term revenue mobilization strategy. However,
introducing a VAT should be postponed to ensure Afghanistan is ready for its implementation, as
the technological capacity of our tax administration is not yet sufficient for administering it. We will
continue consulting with the Fund and the World Bank staff on the timing of the VAT and will work
to strengthen the tax administration so that it can be introduced in the future.
22.
We target a continued improvement in revenue in 2017 and beyond, on account of
ongoing and new revenue (ARD) and customs (ACD) administration reforms. We conducted
functional reviews of the ARD and ACD in 2015–2016, and prepared five-year rolling reform plans in
consultation with our partners. To improve tax administration, ARD will streamline a number of tax
payment procedures, gradually roll out SIGTAS and risk-based audits, and enhance internal audit
functions. To improve customs administration, ACD will operationalize the Customs Academy and
merit based recruitment, roll out ASYCUDA valuation module, and establish within ACD a Preventive
and Enforcement Wing with power of search, investigation, and arrest throughout customs territory.
To this end, ARD and ACD have anchored targets within the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund
(ARTF) incentive program for 2016 and 2017.
23.
Under the ECF arrangement, we will strengthen risk management in ACD and access to
taxpayer information in ARD. ACD will review and update its risk management policy by endDecember 2016 (structural benchmark) to implement multi-criteria risk profiles in all border crossing
points and inland custom depots to effectively identify and prioritize high-risk traders and
54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

shipments for physical examination and post-release verification. To this end, ACD will complete
staffing and training of its specialized risk management unit in Customs headquarters by June-2017
(structural benchmark), which will be responsible for preparing and testing comprehensive risk
profiles by end-2017 through (i) the analysis of past transactions and detection, and the
identification of salient risk elements; (ii) simulations based on past detection; (iii) testing of pilot
profiles; (iv) statistical review of detection with a view to identify and peg optimal levels of physical
and post-release verifications; (v) frequent changes in risk profiles based on feedback; and (vi) close
interaction with post-release verification and compliance units. Selection of declarations to inspect
or review under risk management will also include a random selection through ASYCUDA. The risk
management unit, which will be insulated from outside interference, will report to senior
management, provide a monthly report of results, direct risk management activities in field units
and liaise with field units to obtain feedback, and will have the power to update risk profiles in real
time. The unit will also maintain contacts with other agencies, in particular the Tax Administration. Its
activities will come under a global compliance policy involving (i) physical inspection and reporting
guidelines; (ii) post-release verification and audit; (iii) inter-agency cooperation; and (iv) an annual
plan of control prepared by ACD. We will also link SIGTAS to ASYCUDA (structural benchmark),
Afghanistan Central Business Registry (ACBR), and Afghanistan Payments System (APS) interfaces
over the next three years to facilitate automated information sharing on taxpayers and taxpayer
transactions, which will help improve revenue collection efficiency and reduce leakages.
24.
The development of the natural resource sector and reform of the fiscal regime for
extractive industries remain essential for domestic revenue mobilization over the medium
term. While the development of extractive industries has been hampered by ongoing security
problems, inadequate infrastructure, and declining international commodity prices, we are
amending the mining law, and developing an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)
compliant, effective, and transparent fiscal regime for natural resources. To this end, we will take the
remedial steps towards compliance with EITI requirements set out in the relevant benchmark in
Table 2 (end-June 2017 benchmark). We will submit the revised mining law to parliament and work
together with the IMF and the World Bank to fully develop the mineral fiscal regime by the end of
2017.
25.
As outlined in the five-year rolling fiscal performance improvement plans, public
financial management will be strengthened along several lines. The overall objective is to
improve the quality of spending, make better use of donor resources, better manage public
investments, strengthen treasury’s cash planning, and enhance fiscal reporting and transparency:


The government has adopted a policy of working towards a consolidated national budget. The
split between the operational budget and the development budget results in budget
fragmentation and a proliferation of projects in the development budget. In addition, the
development budget is in multiple currencies, subject to multiple donor conditionality. We
believe that the low execution rate of the development budget is mainly due to unrealistic
estimates of expenditure. Other factors include poor project preparation, imprecise project
costing, premature inclusion of projects in the budget, ambitious multi-year spending plans

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

(with large carry-overs of unspent allocations from previous years), incentives for the donors
and line ministries to “front-load” the budget, capacity constraints with procurement planning
and execution, slow approval (bureaucracy) and centralized procurement processes, poor
contract management, earmarked donor funding that cannot be reallocated, worsening
security situation preventing the execution of projects in some regions, capacity constraints at
line ministries, and lack of commitment towards budget execution.


We plan to address these issues through reforms outlined in the Public Financial Management
Road Map II. As noted, MOF is engaging with line ministries to be part of the 5-year planning
process to enhance their budget execution capacity and we will continue to engage with
donors to increase flexibility of funding according to their bilateral and multilateral
commitments.



The lack of consistent information on the total cost, year-wise phasing, contractual
commitments, and expenditure incurred on various development projects also hampers the
monitoring of performance of the development budget. Unspent budgeted amounts are
routinely carried over into the next year with little or no opportunity for the government to
discuss with donors the possibility of shifting resources from low performing or low priority
investment/development projects to high performing or high priority ones.



While the government recognizes that the shift to a consolidated national budget will take
some time, the foundations need to be laid now. With improved budget costing under robust
forward estimates and some flexibility, execution of the development budget should aim at 57
percent in 2016 and rise to close to 100 percent over the next five years.



We will strengthen development budget management by establishing a development projects
database for the 50 largest projects (in terms of value). This database would be maintained by
the MOF’s Budget Department and would contain specific information (see Annex 1). This
development projects database would help inform the MTFF and the framework of rolling
forward estimates to protect the allocations needed in future years (as per project phasing) to
complete the ongoing projects, identify the remaining fiscal space for new projects, and
systematically take account of required recurrent allocations (in future year budgets/forward
estimates framework) for operation and maintenance of capital assets created. By tracking the
key milestones of large projects, it would also help us to prepare more realistic development
budget estimates.



We will strengthen commitment control and cash management by tracking commitments
during budget execution and requiring financial plans from ministries/agencies as a basis for
issuance of in-year allotments (structural benchmark). We will track contractual commitments
(including forward year commitments under multi-year contracts) by ministries/agencies
through the AFMIS (purchasing module) starting with transactions valued above Af 1,000,000.
The Budget Department of the MOF will issue phased allotments (i.e. annual allocations at
budget minor head level divided into quarterly tranches based on financial plans submitted by
a ministry/agency) to ministries/agencies based on procurement plans and financial plans

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

submitted by them. The financial plans of individual ministries/agencies, backed by allotments
by the Budget Department, would be uploaded into the AFMIS and linked to the consolidated
cash plan of the Treasury. The Treasury will control payments by the ministries/agencies during
budget execution against their respective authorized financial plans. Any in-year revisions to
the ministries/agencies’ financial plans would be subject to review and approval by the Budget
Department and Treasury.


We are implementing a new budget process based on rolling forward year estimates of the
costs of existing policy and any policy changes and identification of fiscal space for new policies
and programs/projects. This will guide the development and issuance of ceilings by the MOF to
ministries/agencies. The ministries/agencies are also initiating plans to establish systems for
preparing medium-term costed development strategies with a portfolio of costed development
projects with an output orientation and forward estimates (these will be called Portfolio Budget
Statements). These medium-term development strategies of ministries/agencies will be clearly
linked to the medium-term ceilings issued to them by the MOF. These will be prepared starting
with key priority sectors (such as infrastructure, energy, and agriculture) and all ministries will
be covered by 2020. The sequencing plan for ministries to undertake costing reviews of existing
policies will be developed this year. Portfolio Budget Statements will be developed to ensure
comparability with the Portfolio Annual Reports of financial and non-financial performance.



We will improve development projects management by taking concrete measures, both in the
near- and medium term, to strengthen development project planning and preparation and
streamline the process of project implementation. In the near term, the measures will include (i)
developing and enforcing a procedure that no project will be funded in the budget unless all
preparatory steps—e.g., project feasibility study, technical design of the project, project costing
and appraisal, environmental and social impact assessment, etc.—have been completed
establishing its readiness for implementation after funding; and (ii) issuing a decree/instruction
requiring ministries/agencies to ensure that clearances/approvals at various stages of project
implementation don’t pass through more than two levels in the administrative hierarchy. Over
the medium term, we would also develop and approve by Cabinet an action plan to address
identified gaps/weaknesses based on a comprehensive assessment of the public investment
management cycle and associated institutional framework. This assessment could be based on
the IMF’s Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) framework or a similar
assessment.



In 2013, we proposed amendments to the laws governing public enterprises (Tassady Law) and
corporations (Corporations and Limited Liability Companies Law) to bring such entities under
the ownership and effective oversight of the MOF. We will work with the Parliament to pass
these amendments promptly. We will review the capacity of the department of state owned
corporations and enterprises (SOCEs) to assess needed staffing, and seek technical assistance
to improve staff’s capacity for operational and financial oversight of the SOCEs. The department
will then start collecting information on financial flows between the government and the
SOCEs, and prepare annual analytical reports on their financial performance.

Financial Sector Reform
26.
Our financial sector strategy is two-pronged. Our first priority is to further consolidate
financial stability, by addressing the remaining weaknesses in the banking system, to strengthen
public confidence and prevent contingent fiscal liabilities to materialize again. This will provide the
sound foundation required for our second priority, the deployment of a range of growth-friendly
initiatives in the financial sector.
Consolidating Financial Stability
27.
We are entering into the final phase of the resolution of the 2011 Kabul Bank collapse.
Recoveries and settlements have reached a respectable US$364 million by April 2016, including
US$203 million in cash, but they are now, as expected, losing steam. Our recovery efforts for the
remaining US$658 million of claims will nevertheless continue unabated, in particular against the
two former shareholders who still owe US$512 million.
28.
We are taking steps to relieve both DAB and NKB from any further exposure to the
results of the liquidation of Kabul Bank, with a view to improve the transparency and the
quality of their balance sheets and transition NKB towards becoming a sound financial
institution. DAB’s lender-of-last-resort (LLRF) exposure to Kabul Bank of US$825 million was
underwritten in 2012 by a Promissory Note from the MOF that also included a repayment schedule.
However, since 2014 the schedule has not been adhered to, and, with interest accruing, the balance
started to rise again, reaching US$415 million by end-2015. Given fiscal circumstances and risks, we
are currently not in a position to meet the unpaid obligations that have accrued under the
promissory note schedule since 2014. However, we recognize the need to move forward with the
settlement of this incident and to improve the quality of DAB’s balance sheet, and will therefore do
the following:


By end-December 2016 (structural benchmark), the LLRF exposure of DAB will be brought down
by US$84 million (through the payments of US$31 million from the Kabul Bank Receivership;
assignment of US$42 million from DAB’s 2015 profits; and execution of the budget allocation of
US$11 million);



We will include in the FY2017 budget an explicit allocation for the transfer to the Kabul Bank
Receivership of US$50 million that the MOF owes for Kabul Bank assets taken over by
government entities. This amount will be applied to the further reduction of the LLRF balance by
end-June 2017.



Starting in 2017 and by end-2019, the remaining LLRF balance will be fully eliminated by means
of capital transfers to DAB that will be transparently reflected in the budget.

29.
New Kabul Bank is transitioning from a temporary bridge bank without capital to a
depositor-oriented, adequately capitalized institution. When NKB was established in 2011, it was
granted regulatory forbearance to act as a bridge bank for up to 18 months without any capital and

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

assume the remaining liabilities of Kabul Bank, while refraining from any lending activity. The
balancing items included tangible assets, but also commitments to receive the proceeds of
recoveries from the failed bank that did not materialize in full, a shortage valued at US$41 million at
end-2015. By that time, it had also accumulated US$50 million in current losses, as a result of its role
as the safe haven successor to Kabul Bank, but it has gradually improved its performance and is now
close to the break-even point on profitability. To turn the page of the negative legacy of the Kabul
Bank incident, we will complete the recapitalization of NKB by end-December 2016 (structural
benchmark) for an amount of US$91 million plus a US$15 million capital cushion. We will continue
to consider the future of NKB, including its possible eventual privatization.
30.
We are establishing a new unit to monitor and report on the fiscal risk posed by stateowned commercial banks (SOCBs). This will involve setting up additional reporting requirements
in accordance with good international practice for accounting and disclosures. Annual fiscal risk
reports will be produced and narratives included in the annual budget papers.
31.
The three SOCBs will continue to give priority to prudent management while their
remaining issues are being addressed. These include serious governance shortcomings being
addressed resolutely by the supervision department of DAB. We started a dialogue with the World
Bank to request technical assistance to align corporate governance of SOCBs with global best
practices. During a transitory period, while all its identified weaknesses are addressed, NKB will not
change its current lending policy. Pashtany Bank, which has only recently recognized in its books the
large losses on its loan portfolio accumulated over the years, will first focus on improving its
governance, including installing fit and proper managers, and on demonstrating its financial viability
before giving consideration to a resumption of its lending activities. In the meantime, the Bad Debt
Commission will pursue its mission. We will also seek the World Bank’s support to enhance SOCBs’
efficiency through automation of major banking functions and modernization of payment systems
to minimize operational risks. The SOCBs business model will thus temporarily consist in focusing on
safety, governance and efficiency, freeing the space for the soundest private banks to develop and
support the economy.
32.
Our capacity building efforts in the field of prudential regulation and supervision are
progressing. The 2014–2018 Strategic Action Plan (SAP) developed with the Middle East Technical
Assistance Center (METAC) continues to be implemented, with the assistance of a range of donors,
and will be further supported by a new World Bank project under preparation and soon to be
finalized. An update of the SAP will take place by mid-2017, including an extension to incorporate a
bank resolution framework. IMF targeted technical assistance, in support of the SAP implementation,
has been requested in the area of prudential regulations and stress-testing.
Toward a More Growth-Friendly Financial Sector
33.
We are in the process of requesting the World Bank to provide support to develop a
“National Financial Inclusion Strategy.” We expect to start this effort at the national level by the
third quarter of 2016 and finalize the strategy towards the end of 2017 under the leadership of DAB.
The strategy will include a comprehensive “access to finance” agenda, including for agriculture

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

where the diverse grass root initiatives will be coordinated with the action of the Agriculture
Development Fund to leverage their impact. The strategy will target an improvement in the financial
sector infrastructure, introduce a wider range of financial instruments, facilitate financial
intermediation and support innovative financing for the private sector. Key components of the
strategy will also consider strengthening consumer protection, improving financial literacy, and
building capacity for the commercial banks’ staff.
34.
We are also coordinating with the banking profession to prudently foster
intermediation. The banking system’s particularly low loan-to-deposit ratio of 19 percent is an
impediment to growth in the private sector. While the SOCBs focus on the resolution of their
pending issues, the most robust of the private banks have room to prudently and gradually expand
their loan portfolios and the range of funding techniques that they offer to their customers. DAB will
adjust its communication with them and review regulations that might be overly demanding,
discouraging intermediation even by the strongest banks.
Safeguards Assessment
35.
We are committed to meeting all the requirements of the Fund’s Safeguards
Assessments Policy and will take all the necessary steps to facilitate the completion of an
assessment of Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) by the first review of the program. DAB’s audited
annual financial statements will be published without delay, and we will provide Fund staff with all
requested information and documentation. Moreover, we will instruct DAB’s external auditors to
provide copies of audit related reports and management letters, and hold discussions with Fund
staff concerning the results of the most recent external audits of DAB. We are also committed to
implementing any safeguards related recommendation, including in the legal area, under the
deadlines agreed with Fund staff.
Economic Governance
36.
Our government puts anti-corruption efforts high on its agenda and has taken steps to
improve the legal framework, strengthen the institutional framework. A High Council for Good
Governance, Justice, and Anti-Corruption has been established and chaired by the President to
coordinate the development of a national strategy on anti-corruption, facilitate inter-agency
collaboration, and consolidate anti-corruption enforcement efforts. We are drafting a national anticorruption strategy to be endorsed by the high council on governance, justice and anti-corruption.
We have taken steps to strengthen the legal framework notably by preparing a draft appendix to
the criminal law in the regard of corruption and a draft new law on anti-corruption. In the judicial
system, we plan to establish a special court for financial crimes, the jurisdiction of which will to be
defined by the Supreme Court. In addition, we have published asset declarations of top-rank officials
(ministers and above).
37.
As corruption remains a significant challenge, we are fully committed to further
strengthening legal and institutional anti-corruption frameworks and enforcement.
Specifically, we will criminalize acts of corruption in line with the United Nations Conventions against

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

Corruption (UNCAC). We will also ensure that annual asset declaration requirements cover heads
and deputies of law enforcement agencies, customs and tax administrations, in addition to officials
mentioned in Article 154 of the Constitution, covering both assets legally owned and beneficially
owned, with proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for non-compliance. For the aforementioned
officials not listed in Article 154 of the Constitution, their declarations will be available in a timely
manner upon request to, at a minimum, domestic law enforcement agencies and the Financial
Intelligence Unit. To this end, we will submit to parliament related laws/amendments by endOctober 2016 (structural benchmark) and will work with parliament to adopt them promptly. By
end-June 2017 (structural benchmark), declarations of officials listed in Article 154 of the
Constitution for 2016 will be published freely available and easily searchable on an official website in
Dari and in English. The website will also include information in Dari and in English on the name and
functions of other senior officials mentioned above who have declared their assets for the previous
year, updated on an annual basis, and on the mechanisms to access their declarations.
38.
Building on the progress made in establishing the AML/CFT legal framework, we will
focus on stepping up the implementation. In the past two years, we revised the AML Law and
CFT Law respectively and issued a few regulations toward better complying with international
standards. The priority going forward is to ensure effective implementation of these measures.
39.
We remain committed to completing the action plan agreed with the Financial Action
Task Force (FATF) by September 2016 with a view to exiting FATF’s monitoring process in
February 2017. Furthermore, we will ensure effective implementation of the revised regulation on
currency reporting (which has started at the Kabul airport) to allow detection and deterrence of
physical cross-border movement of illegal proceeds. We plan to adopt a revised declaration form
template and working procedures by October 2016 and publish quarterly implementation reports
starting from January 2017. We will also ensure effective implementation of the Fit and Proper
Regulation including on existing directors, beneficial owners and senior management of banks. As a
first step, we plan to complete collection of information required in Annexes of the Regulation from
all banks by September 2016. In addition, we will strengthen risk-based AML/CFT supervision of
banks and will regularly monitor money service providers (MSPs) to ensure adequate
implementation of AML/CFT measures by these entities. We are expecting to complete the AML/CFT
off-site analysis and on-site inspections of all banks using the risk-based tools by June 2017. With
respect to MSPs, in addition to effective implementation of the recently amended Money Service
Providers Regulation that requires identification of customers, record keeping, and reporting
transactions to FINTRACA, we will hold workshops for MSP managers based in Kabul on their
AML/CFT responsibilities by December 2016.
40.
We will work to improve the timeliness and quality of our data. We recognize the
importance of reliable statistics for sound policy making. There are a number of deficiencies we plan
to correct, particularly in the area of national accounts and balance of payments data. To help us
with this effort, we plan to request technical assistance and training from our international partners,
including the IMF. In order to improve the predictability of data provision to the public, we will
introduce an advance data release calendar by the end of 2016.

D. Program Modalities
41.
We will closely monitor the implementation of the three-year ECF arrangement
through July 19, 2019 with the help of quantitative targets and structural benchmarks. The
proposed performance criteria, indicative targets and structural benchmarks are attached to the
memorandum of economic and financial policies in Tables 1 and 2. The ECF arrangement will be
monitored based on performance through the following test dates: December 20, 2016;
June 21, 2017; December 21, 2017; June 21, 2018; December 21, 2018; and March 20, 2019. The first
and second reviews of the program are scheduled to be completed on April 21, 2017 and
October 23, 2017, respectively. The performance criteria, indicative targets, and the benchmarks are
defined in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding.
42.
Commitments under the Article VIII. During the program period, we will not impose or
intensify import restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions, or introduce or modify multiple currency practices, or conclude bilateral payments
agreements inconsistent with Article VIII, or impose or intensify restrictions for balance of payments
purposes.
43.
Engagement with the Fund. We will work with our international partners, especially the
IMF and the World Bank, to successfully implement the reforms outlined above. We also look
forward to our continued engagement with the Fund and to an eventual resumption of Fund
missions to Afghanistan.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
This memorandum reflects understandings between the Afghan authorities and Fund staff in
relation to the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) during July 2016–July 2019. It specifies valuation for
monitoring quantitative targets under the program (Section A), quantitative targets and
indicative targets (Section B), adjustors (Section C), and data reporting (Section D).
A. Program Exchange Rates and Gold Valuation
1.
Program exchange rates are used for formulating and monitoring quantitative
targets. All foreign assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars will be converted into
Afghanis at a program exchange rate of 68.711 Afghanis per U.S. dollar, which corresponds to
the cash rate of May 21, 2016. Gold holdings will be valued at US$1252.15 per troy ounce, the
price as of May 21, 2016. Assets and liabilities denominated in SDRs and in foreign currencies
other than the U.S. dollar will be converted into U.S. dollars at their respective exchange rates of
May 21, 2016, as reported in the following table.

B. Quantitative Performance and Indicative Targets
2.
The quantitative targets for December 2016 and June 2017, specified in Table 1 of
the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, are1:
Floors on revenue of the central government and net international reserves (NIR); and



1

Definitions of indicators mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3 are provided in paragraphs 4–17.

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN



Ceilings on reserve money; net central bank credit to the central government (NCG);
contracting and/or guaranteeing new medium- and long-term non-concessional external
debt by the public sector, (continuous); contracting and/or guaranteeing new short-term
external debt by the public sector (continuous); accumulation of external payment arrears,
excluding interest on preexisting arrears (continuous); lending from state-owned banks or
the central bank to, or government guaranteed borrowing by, public enterprises in need of
restructuring (continuous).

3.
The above variables also constitute indicative targets for June and September 2016.
In addition, the program includes the following indicative targets for the four above-mentioned
dates:


Ceiling on the operating budget deficit of the central government excluding grants; and



Floor on treasury discretionary cash balance and social and other priority spending.

4.
Revenues of the central government are defined in line with the Government Financial
Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001) but on a cash accounting basis, excluding grants. Revenue is an
increase in net worth of the central government (including its units in the provinces and
agencies) resulting from a transaction.


Revenues of the central government include taxes and other compulsory transfers imposed
by central government units, property income derived from the ownership of assets, sales of
goods and services, social contributions, interest, fines, penalties and forfeits and voluntary
transfers received from nongovernment other than grants. The definition for program
monitoring excludes grants and other noncompulsory contributions received from foreign
governments and international organizations; such transfers between central government
units would be eliminated in the consolidation of the fiscal reports and not recorded as
revenue. Receipts collected by central government on behalf of non-central government
units should not be counted as revenue (e.g., Red Crescent fees). Receipts from the sale of
nonfinancial assets (e.g., privatization and signature bonuses from natural resource
contracts), and transactions in financial assets and liabilities, such as borrowing but excepting
interest payments, are also excluded from the definition of revenue. Transfer of profits from
the Central Bank to the Treasury is also excluded from the definition of revenue.



Revenues should be recognized on a cash basis and flows should be recorded when cash is
received. The official Afghanistan Government Financial Management Information System
(AFMIS) reports will be used as the basis for program monitoring; in particular, the monthly
financial statements prepared by the Treasury department based on AFMIS data. Exceptional
advanced payments will be treated as if received on the normal due date.

5.
The central government consists of the Office of the President, the ministries and other
state administrations and governmental agencies, including the attorney general’s office; the
National Assembly; and the judiciary, including the Supreme Court.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

6.
Net international reserves are defined as reserve assets minus reserve related liabilities
of the DAB, both of which are expressed in U.S. dollars.


Reserve assets of the DAB, as defined in the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual
(BPM5), are claims on nonresidents denominated in foreign convertible currencies controlled
by DAB, and are readily and unconditionally available for DAB to meet balance of payments
financing needs, intervention in exchange markets, and other purposes. They include DAB
holdings of monetary gold, SDRs, Afghanistan’s reserve position in the IMF, foreign currency
cash (including foreign exchange banknotes in the vaults of the DAB, but excluding cash held
in the DAB’s branches), and deposits abroad (including balances on accounts maintained
with overseas correspondent banks). Excluded from reserve assets are any assets that are
pledged, collateralized, or otherwise encumbered; claims on residents; precious metals other
than monetary gold; assets in nonconvertible currencies; illiquid assets; and claims on foreign
exchange arising from derivatives in foreign currencies vis-à-vis domestic currency (such as
futures, forwards, swaps, and options).



Reserve related liabilities are defined as short-term (original maturity) foreign exchange
liabilities of DAB to nonresidents (held at DAB headquarters); all credit outstanding from the
IMF; foreign currency reserves of commercial banks held at DAB headquarters; commitments
to sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and
options); and all arrears on principal or interest payments to commercial banks, suppliers, or
official export credit agencies.

7.
Reserve money is defined as currency in circulation plus Afghani-denominated
commercial bank deposits at the central bank, excluding deposits held at the DAB’s branches
(because of the unavailability of reliable and timely data from the DAB’s branches), but including
balances maintained by the commercial banks in the DAB’s overnight facility.
8.
Net central bank credit to the central government is defined as the difference
between the central bank’s claims on the central government and the central government
deposits at the DAB, excluding deposits held at the DAB’s branches (see paragraph 12). Claims
include the so-called “promissory note”, in the amount outstanding (at face value) of DAB’s claim
on a bank in liquidation that has been guaranteed by the ministry of finance though issuance of
a promissory note, and up to the amount specified therein.
9.
For program purposes, the definition of external debt is set out in the “Guidelines on
Public Debt Conditionality in Fund Arrangements" as set forth in the Attachment to IMF
Executive Board Decision No. 15688-(14/107), adopted December 5, 2014.
a. The term “debt” will be understood to mean a current (i.e., not contingent) liability,
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of
assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or
more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future
point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities

68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being
as follows:
i)

loans (i.e., advances of money) to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits,
bonds, debentures, commercial loans buyers’ credits, and credits extended by the
IMF) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized
loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest,
by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements);

ii)

suppliers’ credits (i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services
are provided); and

iii)

leases (i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the
right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than
the total expected service life of the property), while the lessor retains the title to the
property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period
of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or
maintenance of the property.

b. Under the definition of debt set out in paragraph 11 (a) above, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that
is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise
to debt.
10.
Long-term and medium-term external debt. A ceiling applies, on a continuous basis,
to the contracting and guaranteeing by the public sector of new non-concessional borrowing
debt with nonresidents with original maturities of one year or more. The ceiling applies to debt
and commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not yet been received. This
applies to private debt for which official guarantees have been extended and which, therefore,
constitute a contingent liability of the public sector. Excluded from the limits are refinancing
credits and rescheduling operations, credits extended by the IMF, and credits on concessional
terms as defined below. Consistent with the Public Finance and Expenditure Management (PFEM)
Law, the MOF should have sole responsibility for the contracting and guaranteeing of external
debt on behalf of the government.


The definition of “government” includes the budgetary central government, extra-budgetary
central government, local government (including government departments), as well as official
agencies that do not seek profit and whose budgets are issued independent of the annual
operational or development budgets. The public sector comprises the government as

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

69

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

defined above, the DAB, and nonfinancial public enterprises. Public enterprises are defined
below in paragraph 15.2


For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of the
public sector to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the debtor (involving
payments in cash or in kind), or from any implicit legal or contractual obligation of the public
sector to finance partially or in full any a shortfall incurred by the debtor.



For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least
60percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the
present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal
value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by discounting
the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt.3 The discount rates used is
5.0 percent.

11.
The zero ceiling on short-term external debt applies on a continuous basis to the
contracting or guaranteeing of new external debt by the public sector (as defined in paragraph
12 of this memorandum) with nonresidents, with an original maturity of up to and including one
year.


It applies to debt as defined in paragraph 11 of this memorandum.



Excluded from the limit are rescheduling operations (including the deferral of interest on
commercial debt) and normal import-related credits.



Debt falling within the limit shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at
the time the contract or guarantee becomes effective.

12.
A continuous performance criterion applies to the non-accumulation of new external
payments arrears on external debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government or the
DAB. External payment arrears consist of external debt service obligations (principal and interest)
falling due after July 1, 2016 and that have not been paid at the time they are due, as specified in
the contractual agreements. Excluded from the prohibition on the accumulation of new arrears
are (i) arrears arising from interest on the stock of arrears outstanding as of July 1, 2016; and (ii)
external arrears that are subject to debt rescheduling agreements or negotiations.

2

Government control of an entity can be established based on the following criteria: (i) ownership of the majority
of the voting interest; (ii) control of the board or other governing body; (iii) control of the appointment and
removal of key personnel; (iv) control of key committees of the entity; (v) golden shares and options;
(vi) regulation and control; (vii) control by a dominant public sector customer or group of public sector
customers; and (viii) control attached to borrowing from the government.
3

The calculation of concessionality will take into account all aspects of the loan agreement, including maturity,
grace period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees.

70

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

13.
Lending to, or guaranteeing borrowing by, public enterprises. The zero ceiling on
new lending from state-owned banks or the central bank to, or government guaranteed
domestic and external borrowing by, public enterprises in need of restructuring applies on a
continuous basis.


For the purposes of this performance criterion (i) “state-owned banks” refers to those banks
that are wholly or majority owned by the government (as defined in paragraph 12 of this
memorandum), including Bank Millie, Bank Pashtany and New Kabul Bank; (ii) “public
enterprises in need of restructuring” refers to enterprises that meet either of the following:
(a) public enterprises that have not had an audited balance sheet in the past two fiscal years,
(b) public enterprises that have been identified by the Ministry of Finance for liquidation, or
(c) public enterprises subject to restructuring plans that do not have cabinet-approved
restructuring plans; and (iii) “public enterprises” refers to enterprises wholly or majority
owned by the government, including state-owned enterprises covered by the State-Owned
Enterprise (Tassady) Law, state-owned corporations covered by the Corporations and Limited
Liability Companies Law, and other government entities (e.g., Microfinance Investment
Support Facility for Afghanistan) and government agencies (e.g., Afghanistan Investment
Support Agency) engaged in commercial activities but not covered by the Tassady Law.



It applies to any new loans (or financial contributions) extended directly from the central
bank or state-owned banks to public enterprises in need of restructuring, and also to any
explicit government guarantees for borrowing undertaken by these public enterprises
(including loan agreements and guarantees for which value has not been received).

14.
Operating budget deficit of the central government excluding grants is defined as
revenues of the central government minus operating budget expenditure recorded in AFMIS and
reported in monthly financial statements.
15.
Treasury’s discretionary cash balance is defined as the total discretionary cash balance
at the treasury single account in DAB, including balance in the main TSA account in Kabul and
unspent funds in provincial expenditure accounts, plus the funds in the discretionary
development budget account.
16.
Rerouting of treasury’s IMF accounts to central bank’s balance sheet. For program
purposes, the government’s financial positions arising from dealing with the IMF is treated as if
these functions were performed by DAB on behalf of the treasury that is as if DAB have assumed
these positions and have established corresponding counter positions vis-à-vis the treasury.
17.
Social and other priority spending is defined as the sum of pro-poor spending
identified in accordance with the ANDS poverty profile by the Ministry of Education, Ministry of
Public Health, and Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Martyrs, and Disabled within the central
government’s operating budget for a particular fiscal year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

C. Adjustors
18.
The floor on NIR and the ceiling on the NCG are consistent with the assumption that
core budget development spending will amount, on a cumulative basis from the beginning of
the respective fiscal year, to:
Date

Accumulative over the Respective Year
(Billion Afghani)

December 20, 2016
June 21, 2017

96.2
31.1

Should core budget development spending exceed these projections, the NIR floor will be
adjusted downward and the NCG ceiling will be adjusted upward by the difference between the
actual level (up to the appropriated amount) and the projected level of development spending.
19.
The NIR floor and NCG ceiling are defined consistent with the assumption that the
external financing of the core budget and receipts from the sale of non-financial assets will
amount, on a cumulative basis from the beginning of the respective fiscal year, to:
Date

Accumulative over the Respective Year
(Billion Afghani)

June 21, 2017

225.7
101.0

Should external financing of the core budget (including that associated with off-budgetary
spending coming on budget) and the receipts from the sale of nonfinancial assets collectively
exceed (fall short of) these projections, the NIR floor will be adjusted upward (downward) and
the NCG ceiling will be adjusted downward (upward) by the difference between their actual level
and the projected level. The downward adjustment to the NIR floor for these projections will be
capped at US$600 million and the upward adjustment to the NCG ceiling for these projections
will be capped at Af 29 billion.
20.
Should the ministry of finance recapitalize (receive dividend from) DAB, the NCG
ceiling will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount of this recapitalization (dividend).
21.
Should Afghanistan receive an SDR allocation the NIR floor will be adjusted upwards by
the amount of this allocation.
22.
Should some expenditure currently financed directly by donors outside the budget
be moved on to the operating budget, the NIR floor will be adjusted downward, and the NCG
ceiling and the indicative targets (ceilings) for the operating budget deficits of the central
government, excluding grants, will be adjusted upward, by the actual amount of these
expenditures on the conditions that (i) the moving on budget of these expenditures is justified by
a statement from donors indicating their decision to stop financing them outside the budget;
72

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

and (ii) they are subject to a supplementary appropriation approved by parliament. The
downward adjustment to the NIR floors for these conditions will be capped at US$300 million.

D. Provision of Information to the Fund
23.
To facilitate monitoring of program implementation, the government of Afghanistan will
provide the Fund through the office of the Resident Representative of the IMF in Afghanistan,
the information specified below and summarized in the list of reporting tables provided to the
Technical Coordination Committee.
24.

Actual outcomes will be provided with the frequencies and lags indicated below.



DAB net international reserves: weekly, no later than one week after the end of each week.



Monetary statistics, including exchange rates, government accounts with the DAB, currency in
circulation, reserve money, and a monetary survey: biweekly and no later than 10 days after
the end of the month (four weeks in the case of the monetary survey). The monetary survey
will include the balance sheet of the DAB and a consolidated balance sheet of the
commercial banking sector.



Core budget operations and their financing: monthly and no later than four weeks after the
end of the month. The official reports for program monitoring will be the monthly financial
statements from the Afghanistan Financial Management Information System. The structure of
financing (grants and loans should be separately identified) and expenditure data should be
on a consistent cash basis, with separate identification of direct payments by donors that are
included in budget development spending, with a counterpart grant figure. Core operating
expenditures should be reported on a monthly basis using the budget appropriation
economic and administrative classification in addition to the program and functional
classification as reported in the budget documents. Core development expenditures should
also be reported separately on a monthly basis using the budget program classification in
addition to the economic, administrative and functional classification consistent with the
operating budget. All the data should also compare outturns against the approved budget.
Core operating and development revenues and expenditures should also be reported by
province, separately on the same monthly basis.



External budget operations and their financing (i.e., donor funded spending outside the core
budget treasury systems): semiannually (more frequently if possible) and no later than eight
weeks after the end of the period. External development expenditures should be reported on
a disbursement basis (as currently defined in budget documents) using the budget program
classification (and an administrative, functional and provincial classification where possible).



External debt data: quarterly and no later than six weeks after the end of the quarter. These
will include: (i) details of new loans contracted or guaranteed during the quarter, including
the terms of each new loan; (ii) the stock of debt at the end the quarter, including short-term

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

73

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

debt, and medium- and long-term debt; (iii) loan disbursements and debt service payments
(interest and amortization) during the quarter; (iv) debt relief received during the quarter; (v)
information on all overdue payments on short-term debt, and on medium- and long-term
debt, including new external arrears (if any); and (vi) total outstanding amount of arrears.


National accounts data: annually and no later than three months after the end of the year.
Merchandise trade data should be reported quarterly and no later than eight weeks after the
end of the quarter.



Monthly consumer price indexes (CPIs) for Kabul and other major cities (“national” CPI) with a
lag of four weeks after the end of each month.



Four-monthly and with a three-month lag, financial flows and other key variables of the state
electricity company (DABS), aggregated as well as disaggregated by regional hubs, for the
preceding 12 months and (in the last four-monthly period of the year) a forecast for the
following fiscal year. The report will use the template agreed with Fund staff, with all lines
filled in, but excluding the disaggregation of losses into technical and nontechnical for
regions outside Kabul.



Financial Stability Indicators for each commercial bank: monthly and with a one-month lag
after the end of each month. These indicators will include banks’ prudential ratios, capital
adequacy ratio, liquidity ratio, portfolio quality indicators (e.g., nonperforming loans,
provisions as percentage of classified loans), concentration ratio, related loan ratio,
information on open foreign exchange positions, large loan and deposits statistics, income

Nonfinancial Relations
Exchange Arrangement
Afghanistan is an Article XIV member country. Afghanistan maintains an exchange system that is
free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. The authorities confirmed their interest to move to Article VIII
status. The de jure exchange rate regime is classified as managed floating, although the authorities
have been implementing a de facto float system with no predetermined path for the exchange rate.
On March 22, 2016, the average of the buying and selling exchange rates in cash transactions on the
Kabul money exchange market was 68.36 Afghanis per U.S. dollar.
To conduct monetary policy, the authorities have used foreign exchange auctions since
May 2002 and capital note auctions since September 2004. The foreign exchange auctions were
initially open only to licensed money changers, but since June 2005, they are also open to
commercial banks. The capital note auctions are open to commercial banks. Auctions are linked to
the overall monetary program and are held on a regular basis.
Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation with Afghanistan was discussed by the Executive Board on
November 18, 2015. Article IV consultations with Afghanistan are held in accordance with Decision
No. 14747–(10/96) on consultation cycles adopted on September 28, 2010, as amended.
Safeguards Assessment
An updated safeguards assessment of Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) was finalized in December 2011.
It found that DAB had strengthened some elements of its safeguards framework since the previous
assessment (2008), but an effective internal audit mechanism had not been established. The
assessment made recommendations to address the risks emerging from the Kabul Bank fraud,
including related to central bank autonomy and recapitalization. Since that time, some of the
2011 safeguards recommendations have been implemented, albeit with delay. Amending the law
has been difficult, however, and the recommendation concerning the DAB’s legal structure remains
outstanding. DAB has continued to publish on its website DAB’s financial statements audited by an
international audit firm.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of June 2016)
1.
The new World Bank Group’s Program in Afghanistan will be governed by Country
Partnership Framework (CPF), which is currently under preparation and will cover a four-year period
from FY 2017 through FY 2020. Prior to the CPF the World Bank engagement was defined by Interim
Strategy Notes. The CPF will is aligned with country priorities as outlined in the Government;
“Realizing Self Reliance: Commitments to Reforms and Renewed Partnership” paper presented to
the London Afghanistan Conference in December 2014 as well as its more recent draft Country
Development Strategy. The CPF also builds on the findings and recommendations of the Systematic
Country Diagnostic (SCD), completed in February 2016.
2.
Since 2002, the International Development Association (IDA) has committed a total of
US$3.6 billion in grants (86 percent) and credits (14 percent) in Afghanistan. In addition, the
Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) has generated US$9 billion from 34 donors, and
committed US$4.09 billion for the government’s recurrent costs and US$4.32 billion for government
investment programs. As of June 2016, there were thirty active investment projects in the portfolio
in key sectors including agriculture and rural development, health, education, infrastructure, and
public financial management.
3.
The Bank also administers the ARTF—the World Bank Group’s largest single-country multidonor trust fund. The ARTF provides grant support to Afghanistan based on a three-year rolling
financing strategy. Together, the IDA and the ARTF provide close to US$1 billion per year in grant
resources (about US$200 million from IDA and about US$800–US$900 million from the ARTF). The
ARTF is a key vehicle for providing the Government with predictable and transparent on-budget
financing and provides a platform for policy dialogue between Government and donors.
4.
In FY 2016, the World Bank Board approved the Trans-Hindukush Road Connectivity Project
in the amount of US$250 million, as well as additional financing for an existing project—the Second
Customs Reform and Trade Facilitation Project—in the amount of US$21.5 million. Under the ARTF,
three new projects were approved including US$83 million for Naghlu Hydropower Rehabilitation
Project, US$6 million for DABS TA, and US$50 million for Higher Education Development Project.
Additional financing for existing projects included US$41 million for the Second Public Financial
Management Project, US$70 million for the Irrigation Restoration and Development Project, and
US$45 million for the On-farm Water Management Project. As of June 15, 2016, in FY2016
(July 1, 2015–June 15, 2016), US$593.7 million was disbursed under the Recurrent Cost Window.
5.
The World Bank continues to engage in rigorous analytical work and places large emphasis
on policy dialogue. These non-lending activities have been supportive of the Bank’s lending
program and have played a crucial role in informing government of its strategic choices and
advancing dialogue between the Government of Afghanistan and its international development
partners. In the last fiscal year, the ARTF Steering Committee endorsed the Research and Analysis

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

Program (RAP) which aims to support the government’s policy reform agenda and decision-making.
The program provides an opportunity to introduce innovative ways of working with the government,
universities and local research institutions to introduce analysis and generate knowledge. As part of
the RAP, the Bank is currently engaged in a series of analytical work to enhance understanding of
Afghanistan’s growth and fragility challenges and to inform development response by Government
and international development partners. The initial results of this work will be presented at the
2016 Ministerial Conference on Afghanistan in Brussels.
6.
IFC’s committed Investment portfolio in Afghanistan has more than doubled between
FY08 and FY14––from around US$58 million to about US$135 million in FY14. Currently, IFC’s
portfolio stands at about US$54 million and includes one investment in the telecommunication
sector (Roshan), one investment in the hotel sector (TPS), and two operations in financial markets
(First Microfinance Bank, Afghanistan International Bank––trade facility). IFC’s investments have had
a transformational impact (in terms of access to finance and outreach), particularly in the
microfinance and telecommunication sectors. IFC’s Advisory Services program has been supporting
the Investment program in the areas of access to finance, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)
capacity development, horticulture/agribusiness, and investment climate. IFC will continue to seek
new investment opportunities and engage with local players in order to support the development of
Afghanistan’s private sector, particularly in the areas of infrastructure, finance and microfinance,
manufacturing, agribusiness, and services.
7.
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has US$154 million of gross exposure
in Afghanistan, supporting telecoms and agribusiness projects. In 2013 MIGA launched its Conflict
Affected and Fragile Economies Facility, which is supporting the agency’s exposure in Afghanistan.
MIGA is currently supporting three projects in Afghanistan, of which one is a joint effort with IFC in
the telecoms sector (supporting telecom operator MTN). The other two operations are MIGA-only
dairy and cashmere production projects.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JOINT MANAGEMENT
ACTION PLAN ON BANK-FUND COLLABORATION
(As of June 2016)
1.
The Afghanistan country teams of the World Bank (led by Mr. Saum, country director) and
the IMF (led by Mr. Ross until November 2015, and Mr. Duenwald subsequently) held several
consultations in 2015 and 2016. The teams regularly exchanged views on the recent economic
developments and outlook, identified the macroeconomic priorities and challenges facing
Afghanistan, and discussed ways to coordinate their respective work programs.
2.
As noted, the Bank’s work program is guided by the upcoming Country Partnership
Framework (CPF). The new CPF envisages that the Bank will continue to expand its support to
expanding education and health services, energy, rural infrastructure, as well as institutions and
processes associated with transparent economic and financial management. Regarding economic
management, in 2015 and continuing into 2016, the Bank has supported the government with
technical assistance in the areas of customs reforms, revenue administration, public financial
management and economic statistics. The Bank will also continue to support the Government’s
efforts towards greater financial inclusion. Under the ARTF, the Incentive Program (IP) provides
funds for achievements in revenue mobilization, strengthening PFM and revenue administration
systems (including customs), improving tax policy, the investment climate, and land administration.
Since January 2013, the IP has also supported the government's operation and maintenance
expenditures. The IP provides a total financing envelope of US$900 million for 2015–2017. The Bank
may also initiate consultations with the government on a new Development Policy Grant during
2016.
3.
The Fund’s work program focused on close engagement through the Staff-Monitored
Program (SMP) approved in May 2015 and completed in December 2015. It concentrated on the
following areas: sustaining macroeconomic stability; advancing fiscal sustainability and
strengthening efforts to mobilize domestic revenues; safeguarding the financial sector and
improving banking supervision; strengthening economic governance and fight with corruption;
improving absorption capacity and government effectiveness. The SMP included a set of
quantitative targets, which were met, as well as structural benchmarks which were met, albeit some
with delay. As part of the cooperation effort, the World Bank team participated in SMP missions as
observer.
4.
The Fund focuses its efforts on helping the authorities maintain economic stability, manage
the economic transition, and advance important pieces of legislation, including the new banking law,
the central bank law, and AML and CFT laws. The Fund has also provided advice on monetary policy,
banking supervision, and customs reform. Technical assistance has been provided to the central
bank on problem bank management and external sector statistics. The Fund is helping the
authorities build on these achievements, including through strengthening economic governance,
advancing structural reforms, central bank capitalization framework, developing a fiscal regime for

natural resources, revenue mobilization, further strengthening banking supervision, and improving
macroeconomic statistics. The Fund will continue its close engagement with Afghanistan to ensure
macroeconomic stability.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of June 2016)
1.
Afghanistan is a founding member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), established in
1966. Resuming its partnership with Afghanistan, after a hiatus from 1980 to 2001, ADB supports the
country’s National Development Strategies (NDS) and National Priority Programs (NPPs) as the
agreed foundations of the partnership. ADB has demonstrated strong commitment to Afghanistan’s
development priorities in the London and Kabul conferences in January and July 2010, respectively,
and then at the 2012 Chicago and Tokyo conferences, reaffirming its medium- to long-term
partnership at the 2014 London conferences and subsequent meetings of senior officials in 2015.
2.
Current ADB operations in Afghanistan are based on the Country Operations Business Plan
(COBP) 2015–2017 and the Interim Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2014–2015. A new COBP will
be prepared, which will be aligned with the Interim CPS (extended to cover 2016) and a new CPS
that will be prepared for the period 2017–2020. The COBP is fully aligned with NPPs and the
government’s priorities in the infrastructure sector—the backbone of economic and social
development—with ADB’s investments contributing to Afghanistan’s socio-economic development
in the transformation period. The COBP continues ADB's focus on Afghanistan's energy, transport,
and agriculture and natural resources sectors and will promote inclusive economic growth, regional
integration, governance, and capacity development. The Interim CPS is also aligned with NPPs and
the government’s development strategy—Towards Self Reliance—a Strategic Vision Beyond 2025.
3.
ADB is one of the largest donors to the government of Afghanistan. By end-December 2015,
ADB’s total assistance comprising grants, loans, and technical assistance (TA) reached US$4.3 billion.
Since 2007, ADB has provided all of its public sector assistance on a 100 percent grant basis. Grants
make up around 74 percent of ADB’s overall assistance to Afghanistan. In the July 2012 Tokyo
Conference, ADB committed another US$1.2 billion to support Afghanistan through 2016.
4.
ADB supports co-financing of its projects to increase synergies by combining the strengths
of development partners, governments, multilateral financing institutions, commercial organizations,
and ADB itself. As of December 31, 2015, the cumulative direct value-added official co-financing
amounted to US$605.6 million for 24 investment projects and US$23.7 million for 16 TA projects.
ADB manages the Afghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund (AITF)—a financing modality for
development partners and private sector who are interested in pooling resources to finance
infrastructure projects in Afghanistan. AITF allows development partners to meet the pledge of
50 percent on-budget and 80 percent alignment with NPPs as agreed in the 2010 Kabul Conference.
As of 15 March 2016, the total amount received in AITF was US$395.15 million, with total
commitments of US$526.90 million, including funds from Japan (Embassy of Japan,
US$127.5 million), United States (USAID, US$113.0 million), United Kingdom (DFID, US$119.6 million
out of a total commitment of US$251.4 million), and NATO Trust Fund (US$35 million).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

5.
ADB is the largest on-budget donor in the transport sector. As of December 31, 2015,
ADB has provided US$2.2 billion to construct or upgrade over 1,700 km of regional and national
roads across Afghanistan. This includes US$808 million for the Transport Network Development
Investment Program, which has more than halved travel times on 570 km of regional and national
roads. ADB has also helped rehabilitate four regional airports, increasing passenger volumes now
more than double the pre-upgrade levels. ADB funded Afghanistan’s first railway line between
Mazar-e-Sharif and the border of Uzbekistan, which became fully operational in 2012. To date,
about 10 million tons of goods have been transported. ADB supported the establishment of the
Afghanistan Railway Authority to regulate and ensure the sustainability of the railway sector.
6.
As the largest on-budget donor for Afghanistan’s energy sector, ADB has helped deliver
electricity to more than 5 million people. To date, ADB has provided nearly US$1.2 billion to support
energy infrastructure in Afghanistan. These projects include construction of 1,460 km of power
transmission lines, 16 substations, 143,000 new power distribution connections to electricity grid
and system. The technical assistance projects provide policy and analytical support through the
Inter-Ministerial Commission (IMC), Renewable Energy, Gas Sector Development Master Plan, and
Energy Sector Master Plans. ADB is also contributing to policy dialogue and donor coordination in
the sector, including the financing of master plans for the power and gas subsectors. Key regional
projects for Afghanistan are being supported under the Central Asia-South Asia Regional Electricity
Markets including the Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India (TAPI) gas pipeline project as
well as the Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (TUTAP) electricity
project.
7.
The natural resources sector is another government priority sector assisted by ADB. As of
December 31, 2015, total investment reached US$502 million to rehabilitate and establish new
irrigation and agricultural infrastructure, and strengthen the institutional environment to facilitate
economic growth and improve water resources management. Around 160,000 hectares of irrigated
land have been rehabilitated and upgraded, with work continuing on an additional 260,000 hectares.
The investments have led to a more efficient use of water resources, a rise in agricultural
productivity, and improved farm livelihoods. Over the coming three years, ADB planned to provide
about US$400 million for improved water resources management and infrastructure construction
that will led to water use efficiency and better agriculture productivity.
8.
ADB assistance has improved fiscal management through policy, institutional and capacitybuilding reforms covering expenditure and revenue management, civil service management,

ADB’s private sector operations in Afghanistan began in 2004. As of December 31, 2015,
cumulative approvals in six projects have amounted to US$198.1 million. Total outstanding balances
and undisbursed commitments to private sector projects amounted to US$3.5 million. One of the
major private sector projects is the lending to Roshan Cellular Telecommunications Project. ADB
provided financial assistance in the form of direct loans totaling US$70 million for Phases 1 and 2 of
the project, as well as B loans and a political risk guarantee. In 2008, ADB approved a direct loan of
US$60 million to finance Roshan's Phase 3 expansion. In 2012, this project received an award for

Excellence in Fragile States Engagement from the U.S. Treasury. In the financial sector, ADB invested
US$2.6 million in Afghanistan International Bank (AIB), thus establishing the first private commercial
bank in the post-Taliban regime. Awarded by The Banker Magazine of Financial Times Newspaper as
the best bank in Afghanistan for four straight years (2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015), it is the largest and
most profitable bank in Afghanistan with a balance sheet just short of US$1 billion. In January 2016,
ADB divested its last shares of AIB but had received US$11.2 million from dividends and put options.

ADB is an active member of the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board (JCMB) and the
Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund Management Committee. ADB plays an active part in other
donor coordination activities, including the JCMB Social and Economic Development Standing
Committee, the Ministry of Finance's High Level Committee on Aid Effectiveness, and the InterMinisterial Committee on Energy. ADB strongly supports all international policy dialogues on
Afghanistan. Furthermore, it takes the lead in the infrastructure sector and regional cooperationrelated policy dialogues. ADB is a member of the core donor group to ensure coordination and
harmonization among donors and the government over policy reforms and development programs.
ADB consults continuously with civil society and non-governmental organizations with regard to
project design and implementation.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The key data
shortcomings are in national accounts and in the external sector mainly due to organizational weaknesses and
difficult security situation.
National Accounts: The compilation broadly follows the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA). GDP is
compiled by the production and expenditure approaches (the latter in current prices only). GDP follow-up series
rely mostly on indicator’s extrapolation. The reliability of the indicator series is uncertain since the coverage for
various economic activities is limited. Data gaps are severe for some provinces and some activities. Informal
activities are only partially measured. Foreign trade data should be improved in terms of coverage, concepts, and
timeliness. The 2002–2003 base year is more than 10 years old and needs to be updated.
Price Statistics: The CSO compiles and publishes monthly consumer price based on data collected from
10 cities/provinces and the capital city Kabul. Weights are based on the 2011/2012 Afghan Living Conditions
Survey (ALCS); and data from the 2013/2014 ALCS will be used to update the index weights and to expand its
coverage. Significant improvements are required to align the CPI to international standards and best practices:
improving the index calculation, treatment of missing prices, data collection methods, and quality adjustment
methods. The CSO faces resource and capacity constraints, and data collection issues tend to results in significant
delays. There is currently no PPI for Afghanistan, but there are plans to develop one (dependent on staff and
budgetary resources).
Government Finance Statistics: Fiscal data are compiled for the central and general government on cash basis
based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). The timeliness and quality of the central
and general government core budget data have been improving, particularly after completion of the roll out and
connectivity of the Afghanistan Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) to all central government line
ministries and agencies in Kabul and all provincial offices. With IMF support, the Ministry of Finance is
implementing GFSM 2001, with annual data for both above and below the line transactions being reported. The
authorities are reporting monthly GFS data to the IMF for the central government core budget and the ministry is
also working on expanding the coverage of monthly and quarterly GFS data to general government.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) reports the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) 1SR
for DAB, 2SR for the other depository corporations (ODCs), and 5SR for monetary aggregates for publication in
the IMF's International Financial Statistics (IFS) on a monthly basis with a lag of two months. However, the SRF 1SR
is compiled manually and there are data reporting issues arising from the restructuring of the Kabul Bank. A
mission on monetary and financial statistics, scheduled for August 2016, will assist in developing a classification
scheme to automatically generate the SRF 1SR for the central bank and address data reporting issues, including
those arising from the restructuring of the Kabul Bank.

Financial sector surveillance: Afghanistan reports 11 of the 12 core financial soundness indicators (FSIs) and 9 of
the 13 encouraged FSIs for deposit takers, and 2 FSIs for real estate markets on a quarterly basis for posting on
the IMF’s FSI website with one quarter lag.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments and international investment position (IIP) statistics have been
compiled according to the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. Recently, the DAB has sent the data
converted into the sixth edition of Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual format to
the STA and now the data is under STA’s review. Several TA missions provided by METAC have assisted the DAB in
improving international accounts compilation in the past years up to September 2015. Although net errors and
omissions remain considerable, data coverage has improved and net errors and omissions have decreased. A
direct investment survey is needed and consistently revised historical data should be compiled.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Afghanistan, which has been a GDDS participant since
June 2006, is currently in its successor data
dissemination initiative, e-GDDS.

REQUEST FOR A THREE YEAR ARRANGEMENT UNDER THE
EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS

July 1, 2016

Approved By
Daniela Gressani and
Bob Matthias Traa (IMF),
Satu Kähkönen (IDA)

International Monetary Fund1
International Development Association

Afghanistan continues to be at a high risk of debt distress. Although public debt remains
modest, Afghanistan’s debt sustainability will critically hinge on continued donor grant
inflows (38 percent of GDP in 2015, including both on and off-budget grants) under
substantial fiscal and external deficits and downside risks in the economic outlook.
Given continued donor support in the form of grants, Afghanistan’s debt outlook, under
the baseline scenario, is benign. However, a change in the structure of donor financing
with a gradual shift to loan financing (a customized illustrative scenario) would quickly
lead to an unsustainable debt burden.
Moreover, the outlook is subject to significant downside risks. In addition to aid shortfalls,
risks include the fragile security situation, political uncertainty, domestic revenue
shortfalls, migrant outflows, and exchange rate depreciation. Accordingly, the authorities
should continue their efforts to mobilize revenue and press ahead with their reform
efforts, while donors should continue to provide financing in the form of grants.

This DSA was prepared by IMF staff with input from the World Bank, using the standard debt sustainability
framework for low-income countries (LIC-DSA); see “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint BankFund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries”
http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/110513.pdf. The LIC-DSA compares the evolution over the
projection period of debt-burden indicators against policy-dependent indicative thresholds, using the threeyear average of the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). With an average
2012-14 CPIA of 2.7, Afghanistan is classified as having “weak performance” under the LIC-DSF.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
1.
The DSA’s baseline macroeconomic scenario assumes long-run improvements of security
and political stability with continued reform and a gradual decline in aid dependence. Compared
with the November 2015 DSA, perspectives for growth have weakened over the near term. This reflects a
deterioration in security conditions, the continued impact of the troop withdrawal, a slower recovery in
economic confidence, and delays in budget execution and in implementation of mining projects (discussed
below). In the medium and long term, the baseline scenario assumes political stability with regular election
cycles and continued economic reform with governments delivering on Afghanistan’s development goals
and priorities that improve the business environment and governance to support private-sector-led
inclusive growth. The scenario also assumes a more conservative (compared with the previous DSA) profile
of donor aid disbursement. It is assumed to be sustained near current levels in this decade (averaging
about $7 billion, or 35 percent of GDP, annually), and to be gradually declining afterwards, from about
30 percent of GDP in 2020 to 7 percent of GDP by 2035, with an increasing share being disbursed through
the budget and provided to the civilian sector.2

2.
Growth is assumed to recover gradually as political stability takes hold and structural
reforms are implemented. Given the highly uncertain environment, staff relies on scenarios rather than
projections to quantify the outlook. The macroeconomic framework builds on a scenario presented in the
May 2016 Staff Report3 and assumes implementation of a comprehensive structural reform package. These
reforms gradually raise private demand and public investment financed by higher domestic revenues over
2

The assumptions on exports and imports of goods and services are substantially revised down from the previous
DSA, partly reflecting the downward revision of the assumption on grants (with a particularly large impact on
imports).

the medium term. Afterwards growth somewhat declines but is driven by the private sector helped by the
strengthened business climate, the impact of continued reforms aimed at macroeconomic and financial
stability, and developments across the economy, including mining4 and large-scale electricity and gas
transit projects (the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project, CASA-1000, and the
Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India natural gas pipeline, TAPI). Accordingly, the external current
account deficit is expected to narrow gradually over the projection period.

On the fiscal side, the baseline scenario assumes gradual progress towards long-term fiscal
sustainability, although the financing gap net of domestic financing remains above 7 percent of
GDP over the projection horizon.


On the revenue side, continuous reforms in revenue and customs administrations, the CASA
and TAPI transit fees,5 and introduction of a VAT6 in 2022 are assumed to bring the revenue ratio
to 12 percent of GDP by 2020 and close to 17 percent of GDP over the projected horizon, in line
with World Bank estimates.7



Development spending, including the off-budget component, is projected to be about
10 percent of GDP over the transformation decade (2015–2024), with on-budget spending
increasing by 2 percent of GDP to 9 percent of GDP, to address Afghanistan's large social and
infrastructure needs. Beyond 2024, development spending on budget would wind down
gradually and stabilize at about 6 percent of GDP.

4

Big mining projects are not explicitly incorporated into the medium-term scenario, given that several contracts are
being renegotiated and uncertainties stemming from low commodity prices.
5

Transit fees are assumed at a magnitude of $40 million annually starting in 2020 for the CASA and $250 million
annually starting in 2022 for the TAPI.
6

The VAT is assumed to yield additional 2 percent of GDP over the current business receipt tax.

7

In Afghanistan Development Update, April 2016, the World Bank estimates that simply by improving enforcement
and compliance Afghanistan could collect revenues of up to 14 percent of GDP, and improved tax policy, e.g.,
introduction of a 10 percent VAT, could raise the revenue intake up to 17 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Operating expenditures are projected to increase as a share of GDP over the transformation
decade, as operation and maintenance costs of existing and newly created capital rise,8 and the
size and compensation of civil service gradually grow after 2020, especially in the health and
education sectors. Security spending on- and off-budget remain substantial but decline from
about 20 percent of GDP in 2020 to 10 percent of GDP in 2030 and 7.5 percent of GDP by 2035,
with the size of security forces gradually declining after the transformation decade as security
conditions improve.9 Thus, operating expenditures peak at around 23 percent of GDP by
2024 and decline to below 20 percent of GDP over the projection horizon as security outlays
shrink.



Given these revenue and expenditure trends, the total budget balance excluding grants
remains above 17 percent of GDP in the next decade and gradually declines to 8 percent of GDP
over the projected horizon.



With limited scope for domestic financing through a sukuk, projected to be introduced towards
the end of this decade for market development and liquidity management purposes,
Afghanistan's financing gap net of domestic financing remains over 15 percent of GDP until
2024, then declines to 7 percent of GDP by 2035.



While the operating budget deficit excluding grants is projected to fall gradually from more
than 9 percent of GDP to less than 3 percent of GDP over the projection horizon, fiscal
sustainability, defined as domestic revenues fully covering the operating spending, would not be
reached before 2040.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
4.
Afghanistan's public debt remains modest. Afghanistan passed the HIPC completion point and
received debt relief in 2006. External public and publicly guaranteed debt, mostly to multilateral creditors,
amounted to $1.2 billion, or 7.0 percent of GDP, in 2015.10 11 It is equivalent to 4.0 percent of GDP in

8

It is assumed that the operations and maintenance costs of civilian infrastructure projects that were previously
funded and managed by donors off budget are by 2024 gradually transferred on budget and financed domestically.
9

It is assumed that the off-budget donor-funded security spending is gradually moved on budget by 2031, with an
increasing share financed domestically in line with the increase in domestic revenue.
10

This debt stock is after delivery of the already-pledged debt relief commitments. Afghanistan is still following up
with one Paris Club creditor on its debt relief commitments, as well as with several non-Paris Club creditors on debt
relief on comparable terms. In terms of debt structure and composition, most of the external debt is owed to
multilateral institutions, mainly regional and international financial institutions.
11

Afghanistan owes a small amount (US$ 10 million) of pre-HIPC Initiative arrears to a non-Paris Club creditor, which
continue to be deemed away under the revised arrears policy for official creditors, as the underlying Paris Club
agreement was adequately representative and the authorities have made best efforts to resolve the arrears. See
“Reforming the Fund's Policy on Non-Toleration of Arrears to Official Creditors”
(https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2015/101515.pdf)

present value (PV) terms, about 38 percent of exports, and 40 percent of government revenues (Table 1a).
Under the baseline scenario-in which Afghanistan's financing gap, net of domestic financing, is entirely met
by grants-the present value of public external debt would be about 3 percent of GDP by the end of the
projected period, while total public debt would be 15 percent (Table 2a), both below the indicative debtburden thresholds applicable to a country like Afghanistan. 12
5.
Assuming continued donor support in the form of grants, Afghanistan's debt outlook is
benign. In addition to the existing debt stock, a limited amount of highly concessional borrowing from
multilateral institutions, which is explicitly linked to big infrastructure projects with potentially high rates of
economic and social returns, is planned for 2016. In the subsequent years, limited amounts of similar
borrowing are assumed under the baseline scenario.
6.
The standard DSA shocks do not result in very dramatic outcomes. There is a near-breach of
the debt threshold (the present value of external debt to exports ratio), which suggests a vulnerability to
distress in the balance of payments (exports). Other debt burden indicators do not respond significantly to
the standard DSA shocks. However, it should be noted that the high past GDP growth rates incorporated in
the standard shocks reflect a catch-up from a low post-conflict base as well as spending by international
troops, while aid flows have been exceptionally large and front-loaded to finance post-conflict
rehabilitation and reconstruction.
7.
Potential risks to grant financing put Afghanistan at a high risk of external debt distress. A
customized illustrative scenario assumes a change in the structure of the donor financing with a shift to
loan financing and from 2019 on, 15 percent of grants, assumed under the baseline, are replaced by
concessional loans.13 It is further assumed that the nominal GDP levels remain similar to those of the
baseline, the level of public services envisaged in the baseline scenario is preserved, and no additional
revenue is mobilized. Under such a scenario, two debt burden indicator thresholds (the present value of
external debt to GDP and that to exports) are significantly breached.

12

Under the DSA framework, the external debt thresholds for countries with similar economic performance and
income level as Afghanistan are: for the PV of debt—30 percent of GDP, 100 percent of exports, and 200 percent of
revenues; for debt service, 15 percent of exports and 18 percent of revenues.
13

The DSA published in November 2015 assumed a reduction in grants of 50 percent relative to the baseline.

CONCLUSIONS
8.
Afghanistan's debt sustainability critically hinges on continued donor grant inflows.
Afghanistan's public debt remains modest. Given continued donor support in the form of grants,
Afghanistan's debt outlook, under the baseline scenario, is benign. However, a change in the structure of
donor financing with a shift to loan financing (a customized illustrative scenario) would quickly lead to an
unsustainable debt burden. Moreover, the outlook is subject to significant downside risks in addition to aid
shortfalls, including the fragile security situation, political uncertainty, domestic revenue shortfalls, migrant
outflows, and exchange rate depreciation. Given these risks and large underlying fiscal and external current
account deficits, Afghanistan remains at a high risk of debt distress.
9.
The authorities broadly agreed with the conclusions of the DSA. They emphasized that
continued donor financing is critical to ensure debt sustainability, while delivering on their commitments to
donor community and keeping the debt level low. They recognized substantial risks going forward,
including potential donor fatigue, and underscored the importance of prudent fiscal policy. The authorities
also noted Afghanistan's large upfront expenditure needs, particularly big infrastructure projects with
potentially high rates of economic and social returns, which could support regional integration and growth,
and were open to exploring options to mobilize other types of financing in addition to existing donor
grants. They also acknowledged staff's advice that contracting concessional loans would require careful
project selection and independent appraisal of expected returns to maintain debt sustainability, given the
limited debt service capacity, and for transparent recording of its financial impact. They shared staff's view
that domestic security markets should be developed and that sukuks (domestic borrowing) should be used
as a liquidity management instrument and to build up the treasury's cash balance, rather than to finance
projects or recurrent fiscal deficits. They underscored that further aligning donor support with Afghan
priorities and channeling more funds through the budget could potentially result in expenditure savings
and improved efficiency.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; errors and omissions; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes
contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Afghan authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for Islamic Republic of Afghanistan,
and Abdelali Jbili, Alternate Executive Director
July 20, 2016

We thank staff for the concise report and the high quality engagement with the Afghanistan
authorities during the negotiation of this program. The authorities are also appreciative of the
continued support to Afghanistan by the Executive Board and management, and agree with
staff analysis and recommendations.
Overview
Over the last decade, Afghanistan has made significant progress in rebuilding the economy
and institutions, improving human development indicators, and achieving macroeconomic
stability. Further progress, however, has run into strong headwinds stemming from the
international troop withdrawal, continued security challenges, and political uncertainty. As a
result, growth dropped from an average of 11 ½ percent in 2007-12 to 1 ½ percent in 201315, and unemployment, and emigration rose markedly.
The authorities are determined to address these challenges through wide-ranging reforms to
promote higher and more inclusive growth, while maintaining financial stability and
preparing the groundwork for reduced reliance on donor financing. Having successfully
completed a nine-month Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) in December 2015, the authorities
are now requesting Fund assistance under a three-year Extended Credit Facility in an amount
of SDR 32.38 million, equivalent to 10 percent of quota. Given the absence of an immediate
balance-of-payments need, once donor grants are taken into account, the program aims
mainly at catalyzing donor support. The authorities welcome the indication that access under
the arrangement could be augmented if a balance of payments need were to emerge.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
The growth slowdown that started in 2013, accelerated in 2015, with real GDP growth
dropping to 0.8 percent. Low oil and food prices and weak domestic demand pushed inflation
to negative territory last year (-4.9 percent y/y in July 2015), before it recovered to a positive
reading late in that year on account of the sharp depreciation of the Afghani triggered by
emigration-related capital outflows.
Despite the weak economic activity, fiscal performance was very strong, with a 22 percent
increase in domestic revenue and contained operating budget expenditure, which
significantly reduced the operating deficit before grants. The remarkable revenue
performance reflected the impact of the tax and revenue administration measures introduced
during the second half of 2015, as highlighted in the staff report on the second review of the

2

SMP. The current account deficit, excluding grants, declined, with lower exports more than
offset by lower imports, but remained large at 3 ½ percent of GDP and was more than
covered with official grants. Gross international reserves remained at a comfortable level of
about nine months of imports.
Preliminary indications for 2016 point to some strengthening in economic activity, with
growth estimated at 2 percent, inflation picking up to 4 ½ percent, and further improvement
in revenue collection. While the current account deficit before grants will remain large,
pressure on the exchange rate has eased in the first few months of 2016, in connection with a
slowdown in emigration.
Economic prospects over the medium term are relatively favorable, depending on
implementation of the reform agenda, good governance, security improvement, and
continued donor support. Downside risks related to any one of these factors cannot be ruled
out, and given the challenging tasks ahead, we agree with staff that the payoff of the reforms
is likely to be gradual. Under the staff’s medium-term scenario, growth would increase
gradually to reach 6 percent in 2021, as enhanced governance and improved business climate
boost private sector investment and growth. Trade integration and the development of
Afghanistan as a hub for regional transportation also hold some growth potential over the
medium term. Other quantitative indicators of the medium-term scenario seem sensible,
notwithstanding the challenging environment and the high degree of uncertainty surrounding
future security developments and donor assistance.
Macroeconomic Policies
Policies under the proposed program will be geared toward preserving macro-financial
stability, supporting growth and employment, and maintaining a comfortable buffer of
international reserves. Fiscal policy will be prudent to ensure that the overall budget,
including grants is in balance in 2016 and beyond, with the bulk of the fiscal improvement
coming from stronger revenue performance underpinned by wide-ranging structural fiscal
reforms (see below). Over time, the operating budget balance, excluding grants, will become
the fiscal anchor. Monetary policy will continue to focus on maintaining low inflation, with
reserve money being the nominal anchor due to weak transmission channels, while the
flexible exchange rate regime will be maintained to absorb exogenous shocks. The
authorities will endeavor to reduce dollarization and strengthen confidence in the Afghani,
and DAB will enhance its communication via regular publications.
Structural Reforms
The critical role of structural reforms in establishing solid foundations for growth has been
recognized over the years, including by the Afghanistan National Development Framework,
and re-confirmed at several donor meetings, including the London Conference in December

3

2014. Focusing on the areas in the Fund’s purview, the proposed program puts emphasis on:
(i) fiscal reforms to strengthen domestic revenue mobilization and raise the quality of
government spending; (ii) completing financial sector restructuring and enhancing its
contribution to growth; (iii) strengthening governance and the fight against corruption; and
(iv) improving the business environment in collaboration with the World Bank and other
development partners.
Fiscal reforms
Revenue mobilization will focus on further strengthening the revenue and customs
departments along the lines of the five-year rolling reform plans established in consultation
with development partners as detailed in the MEFP (¶22-23). Building on the important steps
taken in recent years, key priorities going forward include improved cooperation and
information sharing between the two administrations and strengthening their human and
technical capacity, which will improve compliance and reduce corruption. While there is
limited room for introducing new taxes, the authorities will explore the possibility of tapping
other sources of revenue, including excises on selected goods and services, and reducing tax
exemptions. They agree with staff that VAT introduction can be considered over the medium
term after implementation capacity has been strengthened. They intend to develop by end2017 an effective and transparent fiscal regime for natural resources in compliance with
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) requirements, and with IMF technical
assistance, which should help enhance and diversify the revenue base as the sector develops.
A strengthened public finance management system is necessary to enhance the efficiency of
public spending, make a better use of diminishing donor resources, and ensure that budget
allocations are aligned with national development priorities. Key priorities will be to improve
the formulation and execution of the budget and follow up of development projects,
strengthen commitment control and cash management, and enhance fiscal reporting and
transparency. The authorities plan to address these issues through various reforms that are
outlined in the Public Finance Management Road Map II and the MEFP (¶25), and will
continue to work toward establishing a consolidated national budget to integrate the
operational and development budgets while engaging donors to increase flexibility of
funding. They will also improve monitoring of the performance of state-owned enterprises
and strengthen the MOF’s oversight over their finances. To this effect, they intend to work
with Parliament to amend the laws governing public enterprises and corporations.
Financial sector reforms
The financial sector strategy under the program aims at bringing the resolution of Kabul
Bank to an end, strengthening prudential regulations and bank supervision, and developing a
more inclusive financial intermediation infrastructure. In this regard, preparatory work is
underway to develop a National Financial Inclusion Strategy with World Bank assistance to

4

improve access to finance, broaden the range of financial instruments available to the private
sector, strengthen consumer protection, and improve financial literacy.
Progress has been achieved in asset recovery and settlements related to the defunct Kabul
Bank, with the New Kabul Bank (NKB) now transitioning from a temporary bridge bank to a
deposit-taking institution and close to becoming profitable. The authorities intend to
recapitalize NKB by end-December 2016 and relieve it from any future exposure linked to
the liquidation of Kabul Bank. Eventual privatization of NKB will be kept under review.
Similarly, Da Afghanistan Bank’s (DAB) balance sheet will be cleaned from the lender-oflast resort loan to Kabul Bank (US$ 825 million) in steps over the next three years involving
budget transfers to the Kabul Bank receivership and assignment of DAB’s 2015 profits
(MEFP ¶28). The authorities are committed to facilitating completion of an updated
assessment of DAB under the Fund’s Safeguards Assessment Policy by the first program
review.
Efforts will be made in cooperation with the World Bank to address governance and
management shortcomings at the three state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs), and a newly
established unit will monitor and report on the fiscal risk posed by SOCBs. More broadly, the
authorities will continue to build capacity in the areas of prudential regulations and bank
supervision by implementing the recommendations of the 2014-2018 Strategic Action Plan
developed with assistance from the Middle East Technical Assistance Center. Building on
the progress in establishing a legal framework for AML/CFT, the authorities will ensure its
effective implementation, in particular with regard to the regulation on currency reporting at
borders and the fit and proper regulation. They are committed to implementing the action
plan agreed with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) by September 2016 in order to exit
the FATF’s monitoring process promptly.
Economic governance and business climate
The authorities are aware of the significant challenge posed by corruption and its debilitating
effect on the Afghan economy. They are putting together a comprehensive strategy to
strengthen the anti-corruption framework, and have established a High Council for Good
Governance, Justice, and Anti-Corruption chaired by the President to coordinate actions by
various agencies and enforcement authorities. The authorities’ plan under the ECF is to
improve the legal framework to ensure that acts of corruption are criminalized in line with
the UN Convention against Corruption, and there are plans to establish a special court for
financial crimes. Moreover, while declarations of assets of top-ranking officials are already
published, the authorities will strengthen the asset declaration regime including by improving
transparency of asset declarations of other high level officials in customs and tax
administrations and law enforcement agencies (MEFP ¶37). The authorities will continue to
work with the World Bank to improve the business climate and address serious challenges
related in particular to licensing procedures, property registration, enforcement of contracts,
connecting to electricity, and trading across borders.

5

Conclusion
The authorities are determined to address the many challenges facing the economy, and are
committed to implement the policies and reform agenda under the proposed-ECF-supported
program. They are hopeful that the donor community will remain fully engaged with them
during this difficult transition while they prepare for shouldering an increasing share of the
financing and build adequate implementation capacity. The authorities are grateful for the
Fund support and look forward to continued close cooperation under the new program.

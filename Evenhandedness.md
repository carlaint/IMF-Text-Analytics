<h1>Word2Vec and NLP</h1>

This project initially aimed to perform a sentiment analysis on Board of Directors' minutes regarding country matters, but I soon
realized my expectations that canned dictionaries don't work for the IMF that has it's own Fund-glish.

Hence, with this project, I trained a corpus using IMF language, and performed some basic NLP such as word similarities and analogies.

Unfortunately, sentiment analysis could not be performed because the data has to be labeled...
